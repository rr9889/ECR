    <h4>Evidence 1</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> The First Epistle to the Corinthians, authored by Paul, is addressed
        to:
        <blockquote>"Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of
          God, and Sosthenes the brother, to the Assembly of God that is in
          Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, <u><b>with all
              those calling on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
              place—both theirs and ours:</b></u> Grace to you and peace from
          God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" <strong>- 1 Corinthians
            1:1–3 LSV<br>
          </strong></blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Paul is addressing the universal Church, not just the local church
            in Corinth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> 1 Corinthians 1:16 concludes Paul's instructions on Christian head
        coverings:
        <blockquote> "But if anyone wants to argue about this, I simply say that
          we have no other custom than this, and neither do God's other
          churches." </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li> Biblical language scholar <a href="https://www.bible-researcher.com/biog.html">Michael
          Marlowe</a> cites 1 Corinthians 14:37:
        <blockquote> "If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by
          the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the
          Lord’s command." </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li> This demonstrates that Paul taught these traditions, including
            head covering, as commandments of the Lord. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Evidence 2</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://www.benw3.com/">Ben Witherington III </a>(1995)
      explains: </p>
    <blockquote> "Paul is not simply endorsing standard Roman or even
      Greco-Roman customs in Corinth. Paul was about the business of reforming
      his converts' social assumptions and conventions in the context of the
      Christian community. They were to model new Christian customs, common in
      the assemblies of God but uncommon in the culture, thus staking out their
      own sense of a unique identity." </blockquote>

    <h4>Evidence 3</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/person/philip-b-payne/">Payne,
        Philip Barton </a>(2015) argues: </p>
    <blockquote> "If Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:5 were requiring a garment
      covering the head, he would have been advocating something that was not
      customary for Greek women, nor was it customary in the Pauline or Petrine
      churches. Furthermore, Greek women, including women in prayer, were
      usually depicted without a garment covering the head. It does not make
      sense that Paul would assert something was disgraceful that in their
      culture was not considered disgraceful." </blockquote>

        Sproul </a>highlights: </p>
    <blockquote> "The practice of head covering is a uniquely Christian command,
      especially because the reasons for the command are uniquely Christian.
      Rather than Paul appealing to First Century culture, God's direction for
      the use of head coverings was actually counter-cultural." </blockquote>

    <h4>Evidence 7</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="reference-text"><cite class="citation book cs1">Given
            these considerations, it may be best to understand “authority on her
            head” in verse 10 as referring to the authority of the man (or
            husband). This authority allows the woman to pray and prophesy in
            worship as long as it is evident that she is under the authority of
            man, symbolized by the head-covering. The use of exousia in this
            context, where one might otherwise expect a direct reference to the
            head-covering itself, underscores its symbolic role.This
            interpretation is further supported by the chiasmic structure of
            verses 7–10, which clarifies Paul’s argument. Verse 7 states that
            man is the image and glory of God, while woman is the glory of man.
            Verses 8 and 9 emphasize the creation order, with woman created from
            and for man. Finally, verse 10 concludes that a woman ought to have
            authority on her head because of the angels, tying together the
            theological and practical implications of head-coverings in
            worship.In conclusion, while alternative interpretations suggest
            that “authority on her head” refers to a woman’s active authority,
            the traditional understanding—that the head-covering symbolizes her
            submission to the authority of her husband—remains more consistent
            with the cultural and theological context of Paul’s teaching. This
            view aligns with the broader scriptural narrative and the early
            Church’s understanding of this passage.</cite></span> </p>

                  W. Shepherd</a>, in their <em>Commentary on 1st Corinthians</em>,
                explain the traditional interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11. They
                write:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>"Every man who covers his head while praying or prophesying
                  acknowledges dependence on an earthly head rather than Christ,
                  his heavenly head, dishonoring Him."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>They connect this to the Old Testament, where male priests wore
                turbans or caps. Since Jesus was not yet revealed, there was no
                command for men to pray with uncovered heads. The New Testament
                practice reflects the new covenant, where men pray uncovered to
                honor Christ directly. This highlights the shift from Old
                Testament symbolism to New Testament worship.</p>

          <p>Ezra Palmer Gould, a professor at the Episcopal Divinity School,
            observed that both long hair and the veil served as coverings for a
            woman’s head. He explained:</p>
          <blockquote>

                        <p>"Nature itself is therefore a divine confirmation of
                          the constitutional sense of the impropriety of women
                          appearing in the assembly without a head covering (v.
                          13). The words 'for her long hair is given to her as a
                          covering' (v. 15) do not mean that the woman's hair is
                          her covering and that she needs no veil—a view that
                          vitiates the force of 11:2–14. For example, if hair
                          were the only covering referred to in this passage
                          (11:1–16), then verse 6 would have to be translated,
                          'If a woman does not wear her hair, she should have to
                          have her hair cut or shaved off; she should wear her
                          hair,' which is quite ludicrous. Two coverings are
                          spoken of in the passage. This is established by the
                          fact that two different Greek words are used..."</p>

            <p>On the whole, modern interpreters largely agreed that the
              covering Paul required was a veil or material headdress until the
              mid-twentieth century. Although the view that the covering
              referred to long hair had been popular among various groups
              throughout the 20th century, Abel Isaakson was the first to
              present an extended scholarly argument for this position in print.
              His work, <em>Marriage and Ministry in the New Temple</em>
              (1965), offered five key arguments:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Contemporary Judaism had no prohibition against men covering
                  their heads during worship; in fact, priests were required to
                  wear headgear (e.g., Exodus 28:36–40; Ezekiel 44:18).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Greek phrase ἀκατακαλύπτῳ τῇ κεφαλῇ corresponds to the
                  Hebrew phrase for "loose hair hanging down," as seen in the
                  Septuagint (e.g., Leviticus 13:45; Numbers 5:18).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The context of the passage focuses on hair, suggesting that
                  the implied object of ἔχων is τὴν κόμην ("long hair").</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Verse 14 specifically identifies long hair as degrading for
                  men.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Paul’s use of the term κεφαλή ("head") ties the discussion of
                  hair to his broader theological argument.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>More recently, a growing number of scholars have independently
              reached similar conclusions. In a recent article, <strong>Francis
                Watson</strong> notes that this interpretation is gaining "broad
              consensus in recent scholarship." This view can be further divided
              into two camps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Those who see Paul’s concern as primarily about <strong>hair
                    style</strong> for both men and women.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Those who focus on <strong>hair condition</strong>, arguing
                  that men must avoid long hair (as it is feminine) and women
                  must avoid loose hair, instead putting it up neatly.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite this shift, the traditional interpretation—that Paul is
              referring to a <strong>material head-covering</strong>—continues
              to have contemporary supporters.</p>

                  <p>The practice of women wearing head coverings during public
                    worship is deeply rooted in the Word of God and supported by
                    Paul’s theological arguments. Individuals and churches must
                    prayerfully consider this issue and answer for themselves
                    before the Lord, without imposing it as a term of communion
                    with others.Paul’s exhortation in 1 Corinthians 11 addresses
                    the role of women in worship, emphasizing the theological
                    significance of head coverings. He grounds his argument in
                    creation, stating in verse 10, "For this cause (that is, the
                    woman being created for the man)..." This highlights the
                    divine order and the symbolic importance of head coverings
                    as a reflection of God’s authority structure.Recent
                    discussions have rediscovered the relevance of this
                    practice, noting that Paul’s use of theological arguments
                    makes it clear that godly women wearing head coverings in
                    public worship is a divine requirement. This practice
                    visibly reinforces God’s created order and serves as a
                    testament to the integrity of Scripture and Paul’s
                    teachings.In defending the head-covering issue, it is
                    essential to uphold:The integrity of God’s Word;The
                    integrity of Paul’s writings;A component of public worship
                    that visibly affirms God’s authority and created order.While
                    the practice may not be universally enforced as a term of
                    fellowship, its theological and symbolic significance
                    remains a vital part of biblical worship.</p>

                  <p>"The argument is often made that a woman’s hair is

                    15: <em>'her hair is given to her for a covering.'</em>
                    However, we must not assume that this single sentence
                    negates everything Paul has clearly established in the
                    preceding verses. The Greek word for 'covering' in verse 15
                    is peribolaion, which differs from katakalupto, the term
                    used earlier to describe the veiling. This distinction
                    indicates that while hair serves as a type of covering, the
                    veiling mentioned in the previous verses is intended to
                    fully cover the head and hair."</p>

                  <p>I offer this survey of ancient headcovering practices in
                    the hope that it will clear away some common misconceptions,
                    and bring into sharper focus the customs which many biblical
                    expositors have held to be so important for an understanding
                    of the Apostle Paul's instruction to the Corinthians
                    regarding headcoverings. Too often I find that the
                    statements made by biblical expositors on this subject are
                    inaccurate and simplistic. The more research I have done on
                    the subject, the more I have come to see how problematic is
                    the widely-accepted interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2-16
                    which asserts that Paul is merely urging the saints in
                    Corinth to conform to local and secular customs. In my
                    opinion this idea raises more problems than it solves.</p>
                  <p>I conclude that Paul's explanations pertain to an
                    established Christian custom, which may or may not have
                    corresponded to any Jewish, Greek, or Roman custom of the
                    time. Most "cultural background" treatments of this subject
                    have failed to recognize the importance of the fact that in
                    the first century the Church was itself a sub-culture,
                    having its own traditions and customs.</p>

                    Ages, the Reformation, and into the 19th century, when
                    bonnets and hats became more fashionable than spiritual. By
                    the 20th century, the tradition of head coverings in Western

                <blockquote>Naselli explains that head coverings in 1
                  Corinthians 11:2–16 were a deliberate practice reflecting
                  Christian theological principles, distinct from Greco-Roman
                  customs. For example, Roman priests, often men of high social
                  status, pulled their togas over their heads during pagan
                  ceremonies, a practice Paul instructed Christian men to avoid
                  to maintain their distinct identity. Similarly, a woman’s head
                  covering, such as a thin scarf, symbolized modesty, chastity,
                  and submission to her husband, marking her as married in the
                  Greco-Roman context. At the time, some rebellious wives in
                  Roman society rejected this symbol, often indicating sexual
                  promiscuity by removing their veils, further underscoring the
                  countercultural nature of Paul’s teaching. Paul also
                  emphasized the universal principle behind these practices: men
                  and women should visibly reflect God’s design for gender
                  distinctions and marital roles in culturally appropriate ways.
                  Additionally, head coverings served as a testimony to angels,
                  highlighting the spiritual significance of maintaining order
                  and submission during worship. Despite emphasizing distinct
                  roles, Paul noted the interdependence of men and women (1 Cor.
                  11:11–12), affirming that God’s design for gender
                  relationships is both good and complementary. </blockquote>

                  slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters,
                  both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the
                  authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual
                  help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for
                  women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public
                  worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The
                  Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these
                  are not against the great principles of truth and holiness;
                  affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing
                  in the Bible.</blockquote>

                  <p>On the other hand, for a woman to have her head uncovered
                    in divine service is to dishonor her head, it being all one
                    as if her head was shaved (1 Corinthians 11:5). Therefore,
                    it is concluded that if it is a shame for her to be shaved
                    or shorn, she ought to be covered when attending the worship
                    of God (1 Corinthians 11:6). The reason why a man should be
                    uncovered at such a time is because he is the image and
                    glory of God; and the reason why the woman should be covered
                    is because she is the glory of the man, made for his glory,
                    and to be in subjection to him, of which the covering is a
                    token (1 Corinthians 11:7). That she is so is argued from
                    the order of creation, man being not of the woman, but the
                    woman of the man (1 Corinthians 11:8), and from the end of
                    creation, man being not for the woman, but the woman for the
                    man (1 Corinthians 11:9). Another reason why the woman
                    should be covered at the time of public worship is because
                    of the angels then present (1 Corinthians 11:10).</p>

                    seriously. As Terry comments, this final section emphasizes

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">As I said, my experience has
                    been that the "background history" given by commentators is
                    nearly always made up. After all, how can someone living
                    nearly two thousand years later in a different part of the
                    world possibly know what was going on in the first-century
                    Corinthian church? The passage in 1 Corinthians 11 tells us
                    nothing whatsoever about why Paul had to remind the
                    Corinthians of the church-wide practice. I think we can
                    reasonably infer that either men were praying with covered
                    heads, or women were praying with uncovered heads or both.
                    But that's the most the passage itself reveals. The
                    commentators give the impression that they have access to
                    some additional Christian writings from the time of Paul
                    that reveal what really was going on. But no such writings
                    exist. There is nothing. Nada! The only helpful Christian
                    writings we have are those of the early church, written
                    after the deaths is the apostles. What we learn from their
                    writings is that the New Testament commandment on the head
                    covering was practiced throughout the entire Christian
                    world, in all countries and cultures.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>"Paul's directive is not motivated by 'the desire to
                    appease cultural norms' but is based on 'distinctions in the
                    creation record of Genesis 2, referring both to the order
                    and to the purpose of God's creation of man as male and
                    female (compare 1 Cor. 11:7-9 with Gen. 2:21-24).'"</p>
                  <p>"The point, then, is that the ultimate guide for Christians
                    is not culture (or its negation) but nature (physis)—and
                    nature, not as interpreted by culture, but as revealed in
                    Scripture."</p>
                  <p>"Christians are to 'do gender' (particularly, but not only,
                    in public worship) in a way that signals their grateful
                    recognition of both God-given sex differences and the
                    particularity of their own biologically determined sex."</p>
                  <p>"Most pointedly, Paul's teaching has implications for those
                    who are tempted to engage in a range of 'transgender
                    expressions'—attempts to flout gender norms, blur gender
                    distinctions, or transgress gender boundaries, often in the
                    name of 'culture-making.' On this score, Branson Parler's
                    reflection is helpful: 'Our culture-making with respect to
                    gender should not erase the proper creational diversity and
                    difference given in creation nor should it erase the
                    givenness of who we are. Rather, our culture-making is
                    always a response to the gift of who we are as male and
                    female, not something we invent ex nihilo.'"</p>
                  <p>"As O'Donovan gently reminds, growing in maturity involves
                    not only recognizing our body as a divine gift, but
                    'accepting this gift and learning to love it, even though we
                    may have to acknowledge that it does not come to us without
                    problems.'"</p>
                  <p>"In sum, for all its complexity, 1 Corinthians 11:2-16
                    constitutes a clear summons to contemporary Christian men
                    and women 'to embrace the gender sovereignly determined by
                    God at conception and revealed through anatomy, to
                    understand its distinct vertical and horizontal
                    responsibilities, and to live it out for one's entire
                    life.'"</p>

                <blockquote>11:16 Paul concludes this part of his argument with
                  a warning against dissension: If<br>
                  anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other
                  practice - nor do the<br>
                  churches of God. Paul's practice (or "custom" - it is the same
                  word used by Chrysostom<br>
                  in commenting on the meaning of "the nature of things" in v.
                  14) is not only his, but it is<br>
                  the only practice known among the churches of God. This is
                  Paul's final argument at the<br>
                  end of an extended discussion of the subject. That extended
                  discussion employed several<br>
                  different kinds of arguments to the effect that men and women
                  should continue to attire<br>
                  themselves differently in keeping with the established
                  practice of the churches and the<br>
                  warrants found in the narratives regarding the creation of the
                  first man and woman.<br>
                  Some have suggested that Paul means to say that he does not
                  want to be contentious<br>
                  so that if the readers decide they disagree with him that will
                  ultimately be acceptable to<br>
                  Paul. This is a serious misreading of Paul's argument and its
                  conclusion. Paul's point is that<br>
                  our behaviors are not merely a matter of personal preference
                  (as is often thought in the<br>
                  modern [or postmodern] Western world) but are lived out in a
                  community context, and so<br>
                  the well-being of the community (and of the other) must play
                  an integral role in our<br>
                  decisions regarding the attitudes and postures we assume with
                  respect to those around us.<br>
                  Paul began this passage by commending the Corinthians for
                  continuing to hold to the<br>
                  traditions he had passed on to them. As he comes to its
                  conclusion, he reminds them that<br>
                  what he has been defending are the traditions practiced by all
                  the churches of God. If his<br>
                  commendation of them is to stand, those who are uncomfortable
                  about the universal<br>
                  practice of the church will need to learn how to deal with the
                  conflict between their own<br>
                  perspectives and those who support the traditional practice of
                  the churches without<br>
                  becoming contentious.</blockquote>

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 27</span></h4>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>Paul's argument for veiling is rooted in the theological foundation
          of creation. Men should not wear a veil because they are the "image
          and glory of God," while women, as the "glory of man," are required to
          wear a veil as a sign of authority and respect for the divine order
          (Pages 231, 230). The necessity of veiling is signified by the word
          "ought" (opheilei), emphasizing its obligatory nature. Paul ties this
          practice to cultural norms, suggesting that married women typically
          wore veils in public, while unmarried women might not have been bound
          by the same custom (Page 225). The reference to "angels" in 11:10 adds
          a spiritual dimension, implying that the practice transcends cultural
          context and aligns with divine order.</p>
        <p>However, challenges to veiling arise from interpretations of specific
          phrases. For instance, the word "authority" in verse 10 has been
          linked to the wearing of a veil, though some suggest it reflects a
          broader sense of a woman's role and dignity. Additionally, the use of
          the preposition "anti" in 11:15 has been debated, with some arguing
          that it suggests a woman's long hair could suffice as a covering
          instead of a veil, potentially undermining the need for an additional
          covering (Pages 234, 237). This interpretation, however, is contested,
          as it contradicts earlier assertions in the passage that emphasize a
          physical covering (Page 237).</p>
        <p>Further, Paul clarifies that his argument does not imply the
          superiority of men over women. He seeks to avoid any misunderstanding
          that could arise from references to women being created from and for
          men. Instead, he emphasizes mutual dependence in the Lord, qualifying
          the hierarchical implications of his earlier statements (Page 235).</p>

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 28</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Cultural and Archaeological Evidence</strong><br>
          The practice of veiling (e.g., veil, snood, cloak, or shawl) is
          supported by literary evidence and Greco-Roman statues, reliefs, and
          other archaeological artifacts, showing its widespread acceptance in
          historical contexts. (Page 189)<strong><br>
          </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Natural Symbolism</strong></p>
        <p>Leon Morris emphasizes that a woman's longer hair symbolizes the
          natural need for her head to be covered, aligning with nature's
          design. (Page 200)<strong><br>
          </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Historical Translation Consistency</strong><br>
          Early English translations, like the Revised Version (1881), reflected
          the interpretation that men should have "something on the head" and
          women should not be "bareheaded," supporting traditional covering
          practices. (Page 188)</p>
        <strong>Religious and Social Dishonor</strong>
        <p>Christian men who are covered dishonor themselves and Christ, their
          "head," while Christian women who do not coiffure or cover their hair
          bring shame, reinforcing the importance of veiling. (Page 184)<strong><br>
          </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Missionary and Cultural Context</strong><br>
          Paul ties veiling to the missionary witness to nonbelievers and the
          cultural expectations of a shame-honor society, suggesting its
          significance extends beyond personal piety to communal witness. (Page

        <p>x<br>
        </p>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Order and Headship in the Church</strong>: "Paul develops
            the whole subject of the woman's role in the local church. Two
            subjects are discussed—headship (11:3-12) and hair (11:13-16). The
            headship of the man is made immediately and abundantly clear."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>God’s Ordained Order</strong>: "God is a God of order...
            This order extends into human affairs, to government, to the home,
            to the church. In terms of human life the woman has a head, the man;
            the man has a head, Christ."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Equality and Responsibility</strong>: "This does not imply
            male superiority, nor does it imply female inferiority... This is
            God's ordained order and state of affairs."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Display of Headship</strong>: "When a man takes a leading
            role in a church activity, such as praying or preaching, he is to
            leave his physical head uncovered in order to display his headship
            in spiritual things and to acknowledge the headship of Christ."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The Woman’s Role</strong>: "By contrast, the woman must
            display her subordination in the church: 'But every woman that
            prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her
            head.'"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Public Role of Women</strong>: "If and when a woman takes a
            public part in church worship, she must cover her physical head in
            order to honor the man who is her spiritual head."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Teaching Role of Women</strong>: "Women did have a teaching
            role in the church, but it had certain somewhat rigid restraints...
            related not only to God's order in creation but also to the woman's
            leading role in the Fall."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Symbol of Submission</strong>: "For a woman to pray or
            prophesy with her head uncovered means that she dishonors her head
            (the man), and that is the same, in God's sight, as though she were
            'shaven.'"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cultural Distinction</strong>: "The reference is not to
            some token, such as a doily, but to a veil, a proper covering."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Significance of Angels</strong>: "The angels... look to see
            God's order reestablished and reaffirmed in the church—and God's
            order calls for the woman to cover her head when she prays or
            prophesies."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Mutual Dependence</strong>: "'Neither is the man without
            the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.'"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Paul’s Warning Against Contention</strong>: "Paul, it
            seemed, realized that this teaching would be unpopular... 'We have
            no such custom... to quarrel, especially over divinely revealed
            truth.'"</p>

      </div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">"The Greek word rendered in the NIV 'a sign of
        authority' is <em>exousia</em>, which literally means 'power.' The
        Pulpit Commentary states about this, 'The very brief comment of Luther
        sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the
        subject. He says that <em>exousia</em> means ‘the veil or covering, by

        never been satisfactorily explained by any commentator. The Pulpit
        Commentary observes... 'On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be,
        out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always
        invisibly present in the Christian assemblies.'"</div>

      <div class="rt-scroll">"The relationship of a man to Christ is as Christ’s

        "The latest research into Roman clothing practices suggests that married
        women normally<br>
        wore a head covering in public. Winter notes that “it was the social
        indicator by which<br>
        the marital status of a woman was made clear to everyone.” 63 Sebesta
        argues that the<br>
        head covering “symbolized the husband’s authority over his wife.”64 Most
        likely, then,<br>
        Paul has reference to some women who were not wearing an external head
        covering.<br>
        Now, unless one believes that the custom should be applied to our
        culture, it is not all<br>
        that important to identify the exact form of covering. The main point is
        that the woman’s<br>
        action is considered shameful, and for that reason Paul is willing to
        offer a theological<br>
        reason for maintaining the custom of head coverings" (p.11)</div>

        Paul uses <strong>nature (φύσις)</strong> to argue that men and women

        signifying God’s intentional design.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Long hair for women and short hair for men serve as

      <div class="rt-scroll">Women glorify God by fulfilling their God-given
        roles, symbolized by outward signs like long hair or veils, which
        indicate submission to divine intent.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Paul’s concern includes preventing behaviors or
        appearances (e.g., cutting hair or removing veils) that might blur
        gender distinctions or suggest rebellion against God’s order.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Barrett draws comparisons to <strong>Epictetus</strong>,

      <div class="rt-scroll">"Paul is not saying that long hair replaces a veil.
        52 On the contrary, veiling is a reflection or extension of long hair. A
        woman’s hair is to be in a natural state, not curled or braided. And it
        is to be covered with a veil.53 Th e veil thus follows the contour of a
        woman’s long hair and accentuates the glory (δόξα) of her natural beauty
        without creating the social stigma of either immodesty or
        ostentatiousness. The emphasis upon her dress is not one of glamor but
        one of simplicity.” (p. 72).<br>
        <br>
        The <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong> ("covering") is described as an <strong>analog</strong>
        of a woman’s long hair, meaning the two serve related but distinct
        purposes. The veil <strong>reflects or complements</strong> the natural
        beauty and modesty represented by long hair, rather than replacing it
        outright. This interpretation rebuts the "long hair thesis," which
        claims Paul argues that a woman's long hair <strong>replaces the need
          for an artificial covering</strong>. Instead, the passage asserts that
        Paul maintains the necessity of veiling as a <strong>symbol of
          propriety</strong>. Jerome Murphy-O’Connor suggested that περιβόλαιον
        refers to hair wrapped around the head, interpreting Paul’s statement as
        advocating only for long hair, without requiring a veil. This reading is
        explicitly criticized as a misinterpretation because: The Greek
        preposition ἀντί ("as") is interpreted here to indicate correlation or
        complementarity, not substitution. The passage rejects the idea that
        long hair alone fulfills the symbolic requirements Paul outlines.
        Instead, it emphasizes that: Men: Short hair and no veil. Women: Long
        hair and a veil, both serving distinct but interconnected purposes in
        reflecting gender roles and maintaining modesty. Martin controversially
        interprets περιβόλαιον as referring metaphorically to "testicles,"
        suggesting that Paul’s argument contrasts women’s long hair (as their
        natural "covering") with men’s testicles, viewed as their corresponding
        natural marker of masculinity. This theory relies on ancient
        physiological conceptions and is unconventional. The passage rejects
        this interpretation, emphasizing that περιβόλαιον simply means "a head
        covering." (p. 72).<br>
        <br>
        “ Not only is Corinth sur-rounded by other cities where veiling is
        documented, 30 but Pausanias indi-cates that in whole cloth fashion all
        the Greeks share common cultural29) Strabo (11.13.9-10) records the view
        of ‘some’ (τινές) who say that Medea introducedinto Greek culture the
        wearing of a veil even over the face (καὶ ἐπικρυπτομένην τὴνὄψιν).30)
        See n. 14.64 P.T. Massey / Novum Testamentum 53 (2011) 52-72customs-if
        these customs can be traced back to Homer.31 Th is, it must beadded,
        should not come as a surprise as Homer was the literary instrumentfor
        transmitting Greek culture from one generation to the next.” (pp.
        63-64).<br>
        <br>
        “Paul is not saying that long hair replaces a veil. On the
        contrary,veiling is a reflection or extension of long hair. A woman’s
        hair is to be in a natural state, not curled or braided. And it is to be
        covered with a veil.53 Th e veil thus follows the contour of a woman’s
        long hair and accentuates the glory (δόξα) of her natural beauty without
        creating the social stigma of either immodesty or ostentatiousness. The
        emphasis upon her dress is not<br>
        one of glamor but one of simplicity.” (p. 72).</div>

                          verse 15, has been challenging for interpreters.</li>
                        <li>Paul discusses women covering their heads while
                          praying or prophesying, then states that a woman’s
                          hair is given to her "instead of a covering."</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Martin argues that the Greek word <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong>
                          in 1 Corinthians 11:15 should be translated as
                          “testicle.”</li>
                        <li>He posits that Paul is contrasting women’s hair with
                          male testicles based on ancient physiological beliefs
                          associating hair with female genitalia.</li>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Martin suggests that in antiquity, women’s hair was
                          considered part of their reproductive system, aiding
                          in drawing and retaining semen.</li>
                        <li>This interpretation would make Paul’s argument about
                          head coverings relate to displaying genitalia during
                          worship.</li>

                        <li>Mark Goodacre critiques Martin's interpretation,

                        <li>Goodacre examines the two texts Martin cites
                          (Euripides’ <em>Hercules Furens</em> and Achilles
                          Tatius’ <em>Leucippe and Clitophon</em>) and finds
                          them insufficient to support the translation.</li>

                        <li>In <em>Hercules Furens</em>, the term <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong>
                          refers to a metaphorical “vesture” or “clothing,” not
                          a body part.</li>
                        <li>Martin’s interpretation of the term as “testicles”
                          misreads the context and grammatical structure.</li>

                        <li>In <em>Leucippe and Clitophon</em>, <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong>

                          not a direct reference to anatomy.</li>
                        <li>Goodacre notes that a metaphorical interpretation
                          cannot justify redefining the word in 1 Corinthians

                      <ul>
                        <li>Paul had established Greek terms like <strong>ὄρχις</strong>

                          available if he intended to make such a comparison.</li>
                        <li>Goodacre argues that the singular use of <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong>
                          does not align with Martin’s claim.</li>

                          as “testicle” is unconvincing due to insufficient
                          lexical and contextual evidence.</li>

        Wm. O. Walker, Jr. proposed an intriguing hypothesis to address the
        well-known challenges of interpreting <strong>1 Corinthians 11:2–16.</strong>
        He suggested three key points: (a) the entire section is an
        interpolation, (b) it is composed of three originally independent texts,
        and (c) none of these texts were authored by Paul. While this bold
        approach might initially appeal to those familiar with the complexities
        of this passage, a closer analysis reveals that the supporting arguments
        are highly problematic, both factually and methodologically.</div>
