      <h1 id="introduction"></h1>
      <p>Satan or known as The Devil is the mastermind behind all opposition to
        God. The Antichrist and False Prophet are his primary agents on earth,
        leading a global rebellion against God. The Whore of Babylon represents
        the corrupt system they build, seducing humanity into idolatry and
        immorality. The Wicked are the human participants who align with and
        carry out this evil agenda.</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Bible uses various titles to
          describe <strong>Satan</strong>, the adversary of God and humanity.
          In Hebrew, Satan (שָׂטָן) means "adversary" or "accuser" (Job 1:6;
          Zech. 3:1; Matt. 4:10; Rev. 12:9). In Greek, the Devil (διάβολος)
          means "slanderer" or "accuser" (Matt. 4:1; Eph. 4:27; 1 Pet. 5:8).
          Other titles include <strong>the Serpent</strong> (Gen. 3:1; Rev.
          12:9; 20:2), <strong>the Dragon</strong> (Rev. 12:3-17; 20:2), <strong>the
            Evil One</strong> (Matt. 6:13; 1 John 5:19), <strong>the Tempter</strong>
          (Matt. 4:3; 1 Thess. 3:5), and <strong>the Prince of this World</strong>
          (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11). He is also called <strong>the Ruler of
            the Kingdom of the Air</strong> (Eph. 2:2), <strong>the God of this
            Age</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4), <strong>the Accuser of the Brethren</strong>
          (Rev. 12:10), <strong>the Enemy</strong> (Matt. 13:39), <strong>the
            Father of Lies</strong> (John 8:44), and <strong>a Murderer from
            the Beginning</strong> (John 8:44). Other names include <strong>Beelzebul</strong>
          (Matt. 12:24; Mark 3:22) and <strong>Lucifer</strong> (Isa. 14:12,
          KJV), depicting Satan as a deceiver, destroyer, and opponent of God’s
          purposes.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Satan exerts influence over worldly
          systems, governments, and individuals who reject God. His domain
          includes deception, temptation, and spiritual warfare, as he seeks to
          lead humanity away from God and into sin.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- Demons Section -->
      <h1 id="agape-feasts" class="auto-style1">Demons</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Bible describes <strong>demons</strong>
        (Greek: δαιμόνιον, meaning "evil spirits") as malevolent beings opposing
        God and humanity (Matt. 8:31; Mark 1:34; Luke 4:33). They are also
        called <strong>unclean spirits</strong> (Matt. 10:1; Mark 1:23; Luke
        4:36) and <strong>evil spirits</strong> (Luke 7:21; Acts 19:12). Demons
        are identified as <strong>fallen angels</strong> who rebelled against
        God (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 1:6) and are part of <strong>the spiritual forces
          of evil</strong> (Eph. 6:12). A notable example is <strong>Legion</strong>,
        a group of demons possessing a man (Mark 5:9; Luke 8:30). <strong>Abaddon/Apollyon</strong>:
        The "Destroyer," a demonic figure associated with the Abyss (Rev. 9:11).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Demons are powerful spiritual beings that
        operate in both the spiritual and physical realms, seeking to deceive,
        destroy, and oppose God’s purposes. However, their power is limited, and
        they are ultimately defeated through the work of Christ. Believers are
        called to resist demonic influence through faith, prayer, and the
        authority given to them in Jesus’ name (Eph. 6:10-18; James 4:7).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
      <!-- The Antichrist Section -->
      <h1 id="martyrs-commemorations" class="auto-style1">The Antichrist</h1>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Antichrist</strong> (Greek:
          ἀντίχριστος, meaning "against Christ" or "instead of Christ") is a
          figure of end-times opposition to God, mentioned in 1 John 2:18, 22;
          4:3; 2 John 1:7. Other titles include <strong>the Man of Lawlessness</strong>
          and <strong>the Son of Destruction</strong>, both referring to his
          role in rebellion and chaos (2 Thess. 2:3). In Revelation, he is
          symbolized as <strong>the Beast</strong>, representing his power and
          evil influence (Rev. 13:1-18; 19:20). In Daniel’s visions, he is
          called <strong>the Little Horn</strong>, depicting his rise to power
          and defiance of God (Dan. 7:8, 20-25). Another key term is <strong>the
            Abomination of Desolation</strong>, describing his defilement of
          holy places (Dan. 9:27; Matt. 24:15).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Antichrist rises to power as a
          global leader, uniting nations under his rule (Rev. 13:7; Dan.
          7:23-25). His domain includes political control, economic manipulation
          (through the "mark of the Beast"), and the enforcement of idolatry,
          demanding worship and persecuting those who resist.</p>
      </div>
      <!-- The Wicked Section -->
      <h1 id="pascha" class="auto-style1">The Wicked</h1>
      <p>The Bible describes <strong>evil</strong> (Hebrew: רַע, Greek:
        πονηρός) as a force opposed to God, often associated with temptation and
        sin (Matt. 6:13; Eph. 6:16). It is also referred to as <strong>wickedness</strong>
        (Ps. 10:2; 2 Thess. 2:7) and <strong>darkness</strong>, symbolizing sin
        and separation from God (John 1:5; Eph. 6:12). The term <strong>the
          powers of darkness</strong> highlights the spiritual forces behind
        evil (Col. 1:13). The <strong>world</strong> represents sinful systems
        opposed to God (John 15:19; 1 John 2:15-17), while <strong>the flesh</strong>
        refers to sinful human nature (Rom. 8:5-8; Gal. 5:19-21). Other terms
        include <strong>the Wicked One</strong> (Matt. 13:19; 1 John 2:13-14),
        <strong>the Spirit of Antichrist</strong> (1 John 4:3), <strong>the
          Deceiver</strong> (Rev. 12:9), and <strong>the Thief</strong>, who
        seeks to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10).<strong> Belial</strong>:
        A term for worthlessness or wickedness, often associated with Satan (2
        Cor. 6:15).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Wicked are individuals or groups who
        actively oppose God and His people. Their domain includes oppression,
        violence, and the spread of lies and corruption (Ps. 10:2; Prov. 4:16).
        They represent the human agents who carry out Satan’s plans, often
        through unjust systems and actions.</p>
      <!-- Locations Section --><!-- False Prophet Section -->
      <h1 id="false-prophet" class="auto-style1">The False Prophet</h1>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">
        <p>The False Prophet or the <b>The Beast from the Earth</b> (Rev.
          13:11-18) is a deceptive figure in the Bible who leads people away
          from God by performing miraculous signs and wonders, often in alliance
          with the Antichrist (the Beast). Described in Revelation 13:11-18 and
          19:20, the False Prophet promotes idolatry, enforces worship of the
          Beast, and deceives many, even performing great signs to mislead the
          elect. Jesus warned about false prophets in the Sermon on the Mount
          and the Olivet Discourse, describing them as "ravenous wolves" in
          sheep's clothing whose true nature is revealed by their actions (Matt.
          7:15-20; 24:11, 24). The New Testament emphasizes the need for
          discernment, urging believers to test every spirit and remain faithful
          to Christ (1 John 4:1-3). Examples like Elymas Bar-Jesus in Acts
          13:6-12 illustrate the dangers of false prophets who oppose the truth.
          Ultimately, the False Prophet is defeated and thrown into the Lake of
          Fire alongside the Beast and the Devil, symbolizing God’s triumph over
          deception and evil (Rev. 19:20; 20:10).</p>
        <p>The False Prophet operates in the religious sphere, performing
          miraculous signs and wonders to deceive people into worshiping the
          Antichrist (Rev. 13:11-15). His domain is characterized by false
          teachings, enforced idolatry, and the promotion of the Antichrist’s
          agenda through religious authority.</p>

      <!-- Whore of Babylon Section -->
      <h1 id="whore-of-babylon" class="auto-style1">The Whore of Babylon</h1>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Whore of Babylon</strong>
          is a figure in Revelation representing a corrupt and idolatrous system
          opposed to God. Described as sitting on many waters, she symbolizes
          influence over nations and is associated with luxury, immorality, and
          the persecution of believers (Rev. 17:1-18; 18:1-24). Her title, <em>"Mystery,
            Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the
            Earth"</em> (Rev. 17:5), underscores her role in spiritual adultery
          and idolatry. Clad in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and
          jewels, and holding a golden cup filled with abominations, she
          embodies opulence and corruption. The Whore is also depicted as drunk
          with the blood of saints and martyrs, highlighting her violent
          opposition to God’s people. Her ultimate destruction at the hands of
          the Beast (Rev. 17:16-17) signifies God’s judgment on evil and the
          triumph of His kingdom.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Whore of Babylon represents a
          corrupt, worldly system that seduces nations into idolatry and
          immorality (Rev. 17:1-5). Her domain includes wealth, luxury, and
          materialism, as well as the persecution of believers. She symbolizes
          the alliance between corrupt political, economic, and religious
          powers.</p>
        <h1 id="pentecost" class="auto-style1">Locations</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Leviathan</strong>, a sea
          monster, symbolizes chaos and evil (Job 41:1; Ps. 104:26; Isa. 27:1).
          <strong>The Abyss</strong> and <strong>the Bottomless Pit</strong>
          are places where demons are confined (Luke 8:31; Rev. 9:1-11). <strong>The
            Lake of Fire</strong> represents the final destination of Satan,
          evil, and the unrepentant (Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14-15). <strong>Outer
            Darkness</strong> signifies a place of judgment and separation from
          God (Matt. 8:12; 22:13), while <strong>the Second Death</strong>
          refers to eternal separation from God (Rev. 2:11; 20:14). <strong>The
            Chains of Darkness</strong> describe where fallen angels are held in
          judgment (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 1:6).</p>
        <h1 id="pentecost" class="auto-style1">The End</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">While Satan, the Antichrist, the False
          Prophet, the Whore of Babylon, and the Wicked possess significant
          powers—such as deception, miraculous signs, political control, and
          persecution—their authority is temporary and subordinate to God’s
          ultimate sovereignty. Their ultimate fate is destruction, and
          believers are called to resist their influence through faith and
          reliance on God’s truth.</p>
