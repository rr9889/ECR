          <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The Agape Feast was an early Christian
            communal meal rooted in charity, unity, and worship, often held in
            homes and open to all, including the poor. While initially tied to
            the Eucharist, it had no fixed date and was shaped by flexible,
            local practices. Scriptural and early Christian sources—such as Jude
            12, Acts 2:46, 1 Corinthians 11:20–22, the <em data-start="349" data-end="358">Didache</em>,
            and Tertullian—affirm its focus on fellowship, mutual care, and
            equality within the Church. Over time, due to abuses, the Agape
            Feast became distinct from the Eucharist.</p>

            <h1>Pascha<span style="color: #020202;"></span></h1>
            <div>Pascha (Easter) was the central feast of Pre-Nicene
              Christianity, celebrating Jesus’ death and resurrection as the
              fulfillment of Passover. Early Christians, including Irenaeus and
              Hippolytus, agreed it should be observed on the Sunday after the
              14th of Nisan—the first Sunday after the full moon following the
              spring equinox. While Rome supported this Sunday observance,
              figures like Polycarp and Melito of Sardis favored celebrating on
              the 14th itself. The feast symbolized Christ’s victory over death
              and the promise of new life, marked by fasting, catechesis,
              vigils, scripture, prayer, Eucharist at dawn, communal meals, and
              hymns of joy.</div>
            <h1>Lord's Day</h1>
            Every Sunday, Christians observed the Lord’s Day to commemorate
            Jesus’ resurrection (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2). Replacing the Jewish
            Sabbath, Sunday was called the "first" and "eighth" day, symbolizing
            new creation and covenant (Ignatius, <em data-start="245" data-end="257">Magnesians</em>
            9; Justin Martyr; <em data-start="276" data-end="297">Epistle of
              Barnabas</em>). Gatherings featured scripture, prayer, hymns,
            Eucharist, and offerings for the poor (Didache; Justin Martyr). Amid
            Roman persecution, worship often occurred secretly in homes or
            catacombs (Pliny, <em data-start="496" data-end="506">Epistles</em>
            10.96), reinforcing Christian identity through shared faith and
            solidarity (Acts 2:44–45; Tertullian).
            <h1>Ancillary Activities</h1>
            Ancillary Activities, held as needed without a fixed date, reflected
            early Christians’ daily commitment to faith through teaching,
            fellowship, and charity. House churches served as hubs for
            scripture, prayer, Eucharist, and communal meals (Didache; Acts
            2:42–47; Rom. 16:5). Believers shared resources, supported the poor,
            and emphasized generosity as central to Christian life (Acts
            2:44–45; 1 Cor. 16:1–2; Tertullian; Ignatius), embodying love,
            unity, and care for the vulnerable.<br>
            <h1><strong data-start="0" data-end="30" data-is-only-node="">Catechesis
                and Instruction</strong></h1>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []"></p>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Catechesis and Instruction, conducted
              solely before baptism and without a fixed date, were essential for
              preparing converts in early Christianity. The <em data-start="155"

                data-end="164">Didache</em> (c. 100 A.D.) offered basic moral
              teachings and baptismal guidelines, stressing ethical conduct and
              Jesus’ commands. By c. 215 A.D., Hippolytus' <em data-start="310"

                data-end="331">Apostolic Tradition</em> formalized this into a
              structured process of catechesis—covering doctrine, confession,
              and Christian living. This instruction ensured converts were
              spiritually grounded and ready to enter the Church through baptism
              and receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <h1>Fasting</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Fasting was regularly observed on
              Wednesdays and Fridays in early Christianity as a form of penance
              and spiritual preparation. The <em data-start="139" data-end="148">Didache</em>
              (c. 100 A.D.) instructed believers to fast on these days to
              distinguish themselves from non-Christian practices and to ready
              themselves for worship and the Eucharist. This discipline, rooted
              in humility and reflection, became widespread across Christian
              communities in Rome, Alexandria, Asia Minor, Syria, and North
              Africa (Didache 8–9; Tertullian, <em data-start="498" data-end="509">De
                Corona</em> 3; Clement, <em data-start="522" data-end="532">Stromata</em>
              3.2).</p>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []"> </p>
            <h1>The Day of Atonement</h1>
            <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
              <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement
                (Leviticus 16), was the most solemn day in ancient Israel—a day
                of fasting, repentance, and sacrifice. In 2025, Yom Kippur
                begins at sundown on October 1 and ends at nightfall on October
                2. In 2026, it begins the evening of September 20 and ends the
                evening of September 21.&nbsp; This holy day foreshadowed the
                ultimate work of Jesus Christ, our Great High Priest (Hebrews
                4:14), who offered Himself as the perfect, once-for-all
                sacrifice for sin (Hebrews 9:11–14).&nbsp; In biblical
                tradition, the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies only
                on this day, sprinkling blood on the kapporet (atonement cover)
                to symbolically cleanse Israel from sin. A second goat—the
                scapegoat—was sent into the wilderness bearing the people's sins
                (Leviticus 16:21–22), picturing Christ "bearing our sins in His
                body" (1 Peter 2:24).&nbsp; The blood sacrifice, a central theme
                of Yom Kippur, points directly to Christ’s death on the cross as
                the true atonement: “Without the shedding of blood there is no
                forgiveness” (Hebrews 9:22; Leviticus 17:11). In Him, believers
                are cleansed, reconciled to God, and permanently written in the
                Lamb’s Book of Life (Revelation 21:27).&nbsp; While traditional
                observance includes fasting, confession, and prayer, Christians
                can view Yom Kippur as a time to reflect with gratitude on the
                depth of God’s mercy through Jesus. His sacrifice removes sin
                completely—not just covers it—and grants eternal access to God
                (Hebrews 10:19–22).</p>
              <h1>Pentecost</h1>
              <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
                <p data-start="651" data-end="811" class="">Pentecost,
                  celebrated 50 days after Easter, falls on June 1, 2025, and
                  May 24, 2026. It marks the descent of the Holy Spirit on the
                  disciples (Acts 2), fulfilling Jesus’ promise (John 15:26) and
                  empowering the Church for its mission. It signifies the birth
                  of the Church and God’s ongoing presence in the world through
                  the Holy Spirit. Symbols of Pentecost include fire, wind, and
                  a dove, representing God's power, breath of life, and peace.
                  Bishops wear mitres shaped like flames, echoing the “tongues
                  of fire” on the apostles’ heads. Christians celebrate
                  Pentecost to remember that God is active in and through us,
                  equipping us with comfort, guidance, and strength to carry out
                  His mission.</p>
                <h1>Days of Unleavened Bread</h1>
                <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
                  <p data-start="651" data-end="811" class="">The Days of
                    Unleavened Bread, a seven-day festival beginning on the 15th
                    of Nisan (Leviticus 23:6), were observed by Jesus, His
                    disciples, and the early Church—even among Gentile believers
                    (see Matthew 26:17; Acts 20:6; 1 Corinthians 5:7–8).&nbsp;
                    During this time, leaven (yeast) is removed from the diet
                    and home, symbolizing the removal of sin, malice, and
                    hypocrisy. Paul encourages believers to “keep the feast…
                    with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1
                    Corinthians 5:8), affirming its ongoing spiritual
                    significance.&nbsp; Christians may view this feast as a
                    powerful opportunity to renew their hearts, reject sin, and
                    walk in authenticity and holiness, remembering that Christ,
                    our Passover, was sacrificed for us (1 Corinthians
                    5:7).&nbsp; In 2025, the Days of Unleavened Bread will be
                    observed from April 13–19; in 2026, from April 2–8.</p>
                  <h1>Passover</h1>
                  <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
                    <p>In the 1st and 2nd centuries, followers of Jesus
                      commemorated the Last Supper within the context of the
                      Jewish Passover, which Jesus Himself observed with His
                      disciples. This meal, likely held on the evening of the
                      14th of Nisan, included the breaking of bread and sharing
                      of wine, which Jesus reinterpreted as symbols of His body
                      and blood (Luke 22:19–20; 1 Corinthians 11:23–26). During
                      the meal, Jesus washed His disciples’ feet (John 13:5–14),
                      a profound act of servant leadership that became a model
                      for early Christian humility and mutual care.&nbsp; Early
                      Christians in Asia Minor, particularly the Quartodecimans,
                      continued to observe the Passover meal (Pascha) on the
                      14th of Nisan, regardless of the day of the week. Others,
                      especially in Rome, began to shift toward celebrating the
                      resurrection on the following Sunday, eventually
                      developing into what is now Holy Week. The Council of
                      Nicaea (325 AD/CE) later standardized Easter to fall on
                      the Sunday after the first full moon on or after March
                      21.&nbsp; Holy Thursday (or Maundy Thursday) echoes these
                      early traditions. Some churches incorporate foot washing
                      ceremonies and Seder-like meals to recall the Last
                      Supper's Jewish context. In 2025, Holy Thursday falls on
                      April 17; in 2026, it falls on April 2.</p>
