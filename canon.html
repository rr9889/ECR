      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The period leading up to the Council of
          Nicaea in 325 AD was critical in shaping the New Testament canon. The
          writings of Church Fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, and
          Eusebius, along with documents like the Muratorian Fragment, provide
          insight into which books were widely accepted among early Christians.
          This article highlights the key texts recognized during this era.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h2>Matthew</h2>
        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">
          <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
            <!-- Image of Matthew -->&nbsp;
            <!-- Text Content -->
            <div>
              <p>The Church Fathers universally recognized Matthew as the author
                of the first Gospel, written in Hebrew (or Aramaic) for a Jewish
                audience. </p>
              <p>Irenaeus of Lyons stated that "Matthew also issued a written
                Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect" (<em>Against
                  Heresies</em>, 3.1.1), emphasizing its Jewish focus. Papias of
                Hierapolis noted that "Matthew compiled the sayings [of Jesus]
                in the Hebrew language" (<em>Expositions of the Sayings of the
                  Lord</em>), highlighting its role in preserving Jesus’
                teachings and fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. Origen
                affirmed Matthew’s Gospel as the first written and widely used (<em>Eusebius,
                  Ecclesiastical History</em>, 6.25.4), and Eusebius of Caesarea
                confirmed its acceptance as Scripture (<em>Ecclesiastical
                  History</em>, 3.24.6). Matthew’s Gospel was valued for its
                apostolic origin, Jewish perspective, and emphasis on Jesus as
                the Messiah.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Mark</h2>
      <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
        <!-- Image of Mark -->&nbsp;
        <!-- Text Content -->
        <div>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The Church Fathers unanimously
            affirmed that Mark wrote his Gospel based on the teachings of Peter,
            making it an accurate and reliable account of Christ’s life and
            ministry. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Papias of Hierapolis (early 2nd
            century) stated that Mark, as Peter’s interpreter, "wrote down
            accurately, though not in order, whatsoever he remembered of the
            things said or done by Christ" (<em>Expositions of the Sayings of
              the Lord</em>). This connection to Peter gave Mark’s Gospel
            apostolic authority, even though it was not written by an apostle
            directly. Irenaeus of Lyons (late 2nd century) also confirmed Mark’s
            role as Peter’s disciple, emphasizing the Gospel’s reliability (<em>Against
              Heresies</em>, 3.1.1). The early Church accepted Mark’s Gospel as
            Scripture, valuing its close association with Peter’s eyewitness
            testimony.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Luke</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Church Fathers recognized Luke as a
        companion of Paul and the author of both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts
        of the Apostles. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> Irenaeus of Lyons stated that "Luke, the
        companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him" (<em>Against
          Heresies</em>, 3.1.1), highlighting Luke’s role in preserving Paul’s
        teachings. Tertullian (early 3rd century) also affirmed Luke’s Gospel as
        authoritative, noting its connection to Paul (<em>Against Marcion</em>,
        4.2). The early Church valued Luke’s Gospel for its detailed and orderly
        account of Christ’s life, as well as its emphasis on the universality of
        the gospel message. Luke’s status as a close associate of Paul ensured
        its acceptance as Scripture.</p>
      <h2>John</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Church Fathers universally
        acknowledged John, the beloved disciple, as the author of the Gospel of
        John. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Irenaeus of Lyons wrote that "John, the
        disciple of the Lord, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence
        at Ephesus" (<em>Against Heresies</em>, 3.1.1), emphasizing its
        apostolic origin. Clement of Alexandria (late 2nd century) described
        John’s Gospel as a "spiritual Gospel," written to complement the more
        historical accounts of the Synoptic Gospels (<em>Eusebius,
          Ecclesiastical History</em>, 6.14.7). The early Church revered John’s
        Gospel for its profound theological insights, particularly its emphasis
        on Christ’s divinity and the incarnation. Its apostolic authorship and
        unique perspective made it an indispensable part of the New Testament
        canon.</p>
      <h2>Acts of the Apostles</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Church Fathers universally recognized
        the Acts of the Apostles as Scripture and attributed its authorship to
        Luke, the companion of Paul.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Irenaeus of Lyons stated that "Luke also,
        the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him,
        and the acts of the apostles" (Against Heresies, 3.1.1). This affirmed
        Luke’s authorship and the book’s connection to Paul’s ministry.Clement
        of Alexandria (late 2nd century) referred to Acts as authoritative,
        using it to support his teachings (Stromata, 5.12). Tertullian also
        accepted Acts as canonical, calling it "the Acts of the Apostles" and
        using it to defend orthodox Christianity (On Prescription Against
        Heretics, 22). Eusebius of Caesarea included Acts among the universally
        accepted books of the New Testament, noting its widespread use in the
        early Church (Ecclesiastical History, 3.25.1). The early Church valued
        Acts for its historical account of the early Church’s growth, the spread
        of the gospel, and the work of the Holy Spirit through the apostles,
        particularly Peter and Paul.</p>
      <h2>Pauline Epistles</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Pauline Epistles were universally
        accepted as authoritative Scripture by early Christian writers. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Clement of Rome frequently quoted Paul’s
        letters, especially 1 Corinthians and Romans, urging the Corinthian
        church to "take up the epistle of the blessed Paul the Apostle" (<em>1
          Clement</em>, 47.1–3). Ignatius of Antioch referred to Paul as a model
        of faith and often alluded to his epistles, particularly Ephesians (<em>Letter
          to the Ephesians</em>, 12.2). Polycarp of Smyrna encouraged the
        Philippians to study Paul’s letters, stating they would "be built up in
        the faith" (<em>Letter to the Philippians</em>, 3.2).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">By the late 2nd century, Irenaeus of Lyons
        extensively quoted Paul’s epistles, calling them "Scripture" and using
        them to defend orthodox Christianity (<em>Against Heresies</em>,
        3.14.1). Tertullian defended Paul’s letters against Marcion, who had
        tried to edit them, arguing that the Ephesians, Philippians, and others
        were authoritative (<em>Against Marcion</em>, 5.17–21). Origen accepted
        all 13 Pauline epistles as authoritative and frequently quoted them in
        his commentaries. Eusebius of Caesarea listed all 13 as universally
        accepted, noting their widespread use (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em>,
        3.3.5).</p>

        <li>Romans</li>
        <li>1–2 Corinthians</li>

      </ul>
      <h2>General Epistles<strong></strong></h2>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> The Church Fathers universally
        recognized 1 Peter as an authoritative epistle written by the apostle
        Peter.</div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">
        Irenaeus of Lyons (late 2nd century) quoted from 1 Peter, referring to
        it as Scripture and using it to defend orthodox teachings (Against
        Heresies, 4.9.2). Clement of Alexandria (late 2nd century) also cited 1
        Peter, emphasizing its exhortations to holiness and its apostolic
        authority (Stromata, 4.20). Tertullian (early 3rd century) affirmed its
        widespread acceptance, stating that "Peter’s Epistle is recognized by
        all" (On Modesty, 20). Eusebius of Caesarea (early 4th century) included
        1 Peter among the universally accepted books of the New Testament
        (Ecclesiastical History, 3.3.1). The early Church valued 1 Peter for its
        encouragement to persecuted Christians and its emphasis on living a holy
        life.</div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Church Fathers also universally
          accepted 1 John as Scripture, attributing it to the apostle John.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Irenaeus of Lyons frequently quoted 1
          John, calling it "the Epistle of John" and using it to combat heresies
          like Gnosticism (<em>Against Heresies</em>, 3.16.5). Clement of
          Alexandria referred to 1 John as authoritative, highlighting its
          teachings on love and truth (<em>Stromata</em>, 2.15). Origen (early
          3rd century) affirmed 1 John as part of the undisputed books of the
          New Testament (<em>Commentary on John</em>). Eusebius of Caesarea
          confirmed its universal acceptance, noting its widespread use in the
          early Church (<em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, 3.25.2). The early
          Church valued 1 John for its profound theological insights,
          particularly its emphasis on love, truth, and the incarnation of
          Christ.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1 Peter</li>
          <li>1 John</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Revelation</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Book of Revelation (also called the
          Apocalypse of John) was widely accepted by many early Church Fathers
          as Scripture, though its canonicity was debated by some.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Justin Martyr (mid-2nd century) accepted
          Revelation as Scripture, referring to it as the work of "John, one of
          the apostles of Christ" (Dialogue with Trypho, 81). Irenaeus of Lyons
          (late 2nd century) strongly affirmed Revelation’s apostolic
          authorship, stating that it was written by "John, the disciple of the
          Lord" (Against Heresies, 4.20.11). He used it extensively to defend
          orthodox teachings, particularly on eschatology (the study of end
          times). Clement of Alexandria (late 2nd century) also accepted
          Revelation as authoritative, quoting from it in his writings
          (Stromata, 6.13). Tertullian (early 3rd century) regarded Revelation
          as Scripture, using it to support his arguments on the resurrection
          and the final judgment (On the Resurrection of the Flesh, 24).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Rejection Opinion - Dionysius of
          Alexandria argued Revelation was not written by John the Apostle due
          to differences in style, vocabulary, and theology compared to the
          Gospel and epistles of John. He suggested it might have been written
          by John the Elder, a different figure. Additionally, he urged careful
          handling of its symbolic content to avoid misuse.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Eusebius of Caesarea listed Revelation
          among the "disputed books" (antilegomena), noting some churches
          questioned its apostolic authorship. He acknowledged its wider
          acceptance in the Western Church but skepticism in the Eastern Church,
          partly due to associations with Montanism. Overall he acknowledged its
          use by early writers but documented ongoing debates about its
          authority.</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">Origen
        said "The Epistle of James is said to be his." (Commentary on John).
        Origen acknowledged James as Scripture but noted its disputed status, as
        some questioned its apostolic authority.&nbsp; Eusebius of Caesarea
        listed James among the "disputed books" (antilegomena), noting that
        while it was widely read, some churches questioned its canonicity
        (Ecclesiastical History, 3.25.3).&nbsp; Jerome accepted James as
        canonical, attributing it to James, the brother of Jesus (Lives of
        Illustrious Men, 2).<strong></strong><strong><br>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">Eusebius
        of Caesarea said "Peter’s second Epistle is disputed." (Ecclesiastical
        History, 3.3.1). Eusebius noted that 2 Peter was not as widely accepted
        as 1 Peter, with some early Christians questioning its authenticity due
        to differences in style and content. Origen stated "Peter left one
        Epistle... perhaps also a second, but this is doubted." (Eusebius,
        Ecclesiastical History, 6.25.8). Origen acknowledged its use but
        expressed uncertainty about its authorship. Jerome accepted 2 Peter as
        canonical, though he noted its disputed status (Lives of Illustrious
        Men, 1).<strong><br>

        stated "John wrote two Epistles... but the second is disputed."
        (Commentary on John). Origen recognized 2 John as part of the Johannine
        writings but noted that its brevity and limited circulation led some to
        question its authority.Eusebius of Caesarea listed 2 John among the
        "disputed books" (antilegomena), noting that while it was accepted by
        many, others doubted its canonicity (Ecclesiastical History, 3.25.3).
        Jerome accepted 2 John as canonical, though he acknowledged its disputed
        status (Lives of Illustrious Men, 9).<strong><br>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">Accepted

        treated it as Scripture and used it to support his theological
        arguments. He referred to it as a "Catholic Epistle," indicating its
        widespread use in the early Church. Origen also held the Epistle of
        Barnabas in high regard, referring to it as a "useful" and "instructive"
        text (Commentary on Romans). However, he did not explicitly include it
        in his list of canonical books.</div>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">Rejected
        Opinion - Eusebius of Caesarea listed the Epistle of Barnabas among the
        "disputed books", noting that while it was widely read, it was not
        universally accepted as Scripture (Ecclesiastical History, 3.25.4). He
        classified it as a "spurious" work, meaning it was not considered part

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">The
        Shepherd of Hermas was a popular and influential text in the early
        Church, but its canonicity was debated. Early Church Fathers like
        Irenaeus of Lyons, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen valued it for its
        teachings on repentance and moral living, often quoting it as Scripture
        or an authoritative text. However, others like Eusebius of Caesarea,
        Athanasius of Alexandria, and Jerome classified it as non-canonical,
        though they acknowledged its spiritual and instructional value. While
        widely read and respected, the Shepherd of Hermas was ultimately
        excluded from the New Testament canon due to doubts about its apostolic
        authorship and theological content. Despite this, it remains an
        important early Christian text, offering insights into the early
        Church’s emphasis on repentance, ethical living, and visionary
        teachings.</div>
