      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">God
        desires a relationship with humanity, evident in His love (John 3:16)
        and self-revelation through Christ (Hebrews 1:3). Omnipotent and
        Sovereign: Creator and sustainer of all (Colossians 1:16; Genesis 1:1).
        Triune: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit coexist and work in unity (Matthew
        28:19; John 15:26). Eternal and Immutable: Unchanging and everlasting
        (Psalm 90:2; Malachi 3:6). Holy and Just: Without darkness and against
        sin (1 John 1:5; Romans 1:18).

              <h1 id="introduction"><strong>Nature of Jesus Christ<br>
                </strong></h1>
              <p>The Scriptures present Jesus Christ as the unique intersection
                of divinity and humanity. He is eternal, preexistent, and fully
                divine, participating in creation and sustaining all things
                (John 1:1-3, Colossians 1:16-17). At the same time, He took on
                human form to dwell among people, experiencing their struggles
                and limitations, yet without sin (John 1:14, Hebrews 4:15).
                Jesus serves as the Savior and Redeemer, bridging the gap
                between a holy God and fallen humanity (1 Timothy 2:5, John
                3:16). He is Immanuel, God with us, demonstrating God’s love and
                justice while reigning as King and Judge (Isaiah 9:6, Hebrews
                1:8). Thus, Jesus embodies the fullness of deity in bodily form
                and offers eternal life to all who believe in Him (Colossians
                2:9, John 3:16).</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Salvation</h1>
              <p>The overarching biblical narrative emphasizes that salvation is
                a gift of grace from God, obtained through faith in Jesus Christ
                and not through human works (Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 3:5). Jesus
                Christ is the sole means of salvation, as affirmed in Acts 4:12
                and John 14:6, which declare that no one can come to the Father
                except through Him. Salvation involves repentance, confession of
                faith, and a transformed life evidenced by alignment with God's
                will (Romans 10:9-10, Matthew 7:21).Salvation is both an act of
                divine mercy and an invitation to personal relationship and
                renewal, as seen in the work of the Holy Spirit in regeneration
                (Titus 3:5). It is universal in its offer (John 3:16-17), yet
                individual in its application, requiring belief and trust in
                Jesus (Romans 10:13, Acts 16:31). Moreover, while not earned by
                works, a life of obedience and good deeds reflects the faith
                that saves (Ephesians 2:10, James 2:18).Thus, salvation is a
                holistic process involving God’s initiative, human response, and
                the ongoing work of grace to transform lives, rooted in Christ’s
                atoning sacrifice and mediated through the Holy Spirit.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Authority of Scripture</h1>
              <p>Scripture, as conveyed in these passages, is divinely inspired
                and serves as the ultimate authority for teaching, correction,
                and guiding believers toward righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17).
                It is not a product of human invention but delivered through
                individuals carried by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:20-21).
                Scripture holds enduring truth and is essential for
                understanding salvation, equipping believers for every good
                work, and revealing God's character and will (Psalm 119:160,
                John 5:39).Jesus affirmed the authority of Scripture,
                emphasizing its fulfillment in Him and its unchangeable nature
                (Matthew 5:17-18, John 10:35). The Word also serves as a
                foundation for discernment, wisdom, and spiritual growth, guided
                by the Holy Spirit, who enables understanding and application of
                its teachings (John 14:26, Hebrews 4:12).In essence, Scripture
                is the living and active Word of God, vital for faith and
                practice, providing both historical and spiritual insights
                necessary for a life aligned with God's purpose.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Sacraments</h1>
              <p>The sacramental acts of baptism and communion are consistently
                portrayed in Scripture as visible signs of inward grace,
                symbolizing and effecting a believer's union with Christ.
                Baptism represents repentance, spiritual cleansing, and
                incorporation into the body of Christ (Acts 2:38; 1 Peter 3:21;
                1 Corinthians 12:13). Through baptism, individuals publicly
                declare their faith, align with Christ's death and resurrection,
                and receive the Holy Spirit (Romans 6:3-4; Matthew 3:16).
                Communion, instituted by Jesus at the Last Supper, serves as a
                memorial of His sacrifice and a means of spiritual nourishment
                for believers (1 Corinthians 11:23-26; John 6:51). By partaking
                in the bread and wine, participants proclaim Christ's death,
                affirm their covenant with God, and anticipate His return. The
                sacraments reflect the core principles of faith: grace,
                redemption, and the believer's active participation in the life
                of the Church. As outward acts of inward realities, they unify
                believers, emphasizing the communal and transformative nature of
                the Christian faith</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Predestination vs. Free Will</h1>
              Scripture reveals God's sovereignty in predestining salvation and
              humanity's responsibility to respond in faith. Predestination
              highlights God's control and purpose (Ephesians 1:11; Romans
              8:29-30; 2 Timothy 1:9), while free will emphasizes human choice
              (Joshua 24:15; Deuteronomy 30:19). Verses like John 3:16 and
              Revelation 3:20 affirm salvation as an open invitation to all,
              showcasing a divine partnership where God offers grace, and humans
              respond in faith.
              <h1 id="introduction">Afterlife</h1>
              Scripture provides a clear portrayal of the afterlife, emphasizing
              both eternal reward and judgment. Those who follow Christ are
              promised eternal life in His presence (John 3:16; John 14:2),
              while those who reject God face eternal separation and punishment
              (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 21:8). The reality of heaven and hell
              is underpinned by God’s justice and grace, where believers,
              through faith, enter a place of peace and joy (Revelation 21:4)
              and the unrepentant experience consequences for their choices
              (Matthew 10:28). Eternal life is depicted as union with Christ, a
              transformative promise offered to all who believe (John 11:25-26).
              This hope is expressed in Christ’s assurance to the thief on the
              cross: “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43). The
              Bible also highlights judgment, with each person accountable for
              their deeds (Hebrews 9:27), emphasizing human responsibility to
              respond to God’s call (Deuteronomy 30:19).
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Mary</h1>
              Mary, the mother of Jesus, is portrayed in Scripture as a model of
              humility, obedience, and faith. She accepts her role in God’s plan
              with the words, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be
              to me according to your word" (Luke 1:38). As the one chosen to
              bear the Savior, she is greeted by the angel Gabriel as "favored
              one" and reassured of the Lord's presence (Luke 1:28, 30).Mary's
              unique role as the mother of Jesus is emphasized by Elizabeth's
              exclamation: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the
              fruit of your womb!" (Luke 1:42). Her Magnificat, a hymn of
              praise, reflects her deep understanding of God’s mercy and grace,
              recognizing her blessedness as part of God's redemptive plan (Luke
              1:46-55). Mary is called "blessed" not only for her role but also
              for her faith in God's promises (Luke 1:45).Mary's influence
              extends beyond Jesus' birth. At the wedding at Cana, she
              intercedes with her Son, prompting His first miracle (John 2:1-5).
              At the crucifixion, Jesus entrusts Mary to the care of the beloved
              disciple, symbolically extending her role as a mother to all
              believers (John 19:26-27).While Mary is honored for her unique
              role in salvation history, Jesus emphasizes that true blessedness
              lies in hearing and obeying God’s word (Luke 11:27-28). This
              underscores Mary's significance not only as the mother of Jesus
              but also as a disciple who embodies faith and obedience.Through
              these narratives, Mary is presented as a humble servant of God,
              deeply faithful and integral to the story of salvation, while
              pointing all honor and glory to God.
              <h1 id="introduction">Church Governance</h1>
              <strong>"plural elder-led congregational model"</strong> or <strong>"elder-led
                governance." </strong>Christ as the Head of the
              ChurchFoundation: The ultimate authority in the church is Christ,
              who is its head.Verse: Ephesians 1:22 - “And he put all things
              under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the
              church.”Verse: Colossians 1:18 - “And he is the head of the body,
              the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that
              in everything he might be preeminent.”2. Leadership by a Plurality
              of EldersFoundation: The church is governed by a group of elders,
              not a single individual, ensuring shared responsibility and
              accountability.Verse: Acts 14:23 - “And when they had appointed
              elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they
              committed them to the Lord.”Verse: Titus 1:5 - “This is why I left
              you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and
              appoint elders in every town as I directed you.”Verse: 1 Peter
              5:1-2 - “So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder…
              shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising
              oversight.”3. Servant LeadershipFoundation: Elders and leaders
              serve the congregation in humility, modeling Christ’s example of
              servant leadership.Verse: Matthew 20:25-26 - “You know that the
              rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them… But it shall not be so
              among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your
              servant.”Verse: John 21:15-17 - Jesus instructs Peter to feed and
              care for His sheep, demonstrating the role of shepherding
              leadership.4. High Standards for EldersFoundation: Elders must
              meet specific moral and spiritual qualifications to lead
              effectively.Verse: 1 Timothy 3:1-7 - Describes the qualifications
              for an overseer, emphasizing traits such as being above reproach,
              hospitable, self-controlled, and able to teach.Verse: Titus 1:6-9
              - Provides similar qualifications, emphasizing a commitment to
              sound doctrine and the ability to refute false teachings.5.
              Congregational Participation in GovernanceFoundation: The
              congregation plays an active role in significant decisions, such
              as the appointment of leaders or resolving disputes.Verse: Acts
              6:3-5 - The congregation selects seven men of good repute to
              handle practical matters, showing shared decision-making.Verse:
              Acts 15:22 - “Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders,
              with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them
              to Antioch.”6. Shared Roles and Diversity of GiftsFoundation:
              Leadership is not confined to elders alone; pastors, teachers, and
              others contribute to the church’s growth.Verse: Ephesians 4:11-12
              - “And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the
              shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of
              ministry.”Verse: 1 Corinthians 12:4-6 - Emphasizes the diversity
              of gifts and roles within the body of Christ.7. Accountability
              within the LeadershipFoundation: Elders are accountable to each
              other, the congregation, and God for their actions.Verse: Hebrews
              13:17 - “Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are
              keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an
              account.”Verse: Acts 20:28 - “Pay careful attention to yourselves
              and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you
              overseers.”8. Cooperation with Civil AuthoritiesFoundation: Church
              governance acknowledges and respects civil authority where it does
              not conflict with God’s commands.Verse: Romans 13:1-7 - Calls for
              submission to governing authorities, as they are instituted by
              God.Verse: Acts 5:29 - Demonstrates the boundary: “We must obey
              God rather than men.”9. Emphasis on Unity within the
              CongregationFoundation: The church is likened to a body, where
              every member has a vital role to play.Verse: 1 Corinthians
              12:12-27 - “For just as the body is one and has many members… so
              it is with Christ.”Verse: Ephesians 4:16 - “From whom the whole
              body, joined and held together by every joint… makes the body grow
              so that it builds itself up in love.”
              <h1 id="introduction">Interpretation of the Bible</h1>
              <p>"Contextual, Thematic, and Multi-Sense Biblical
                Interpretation."This classification encompasses the
                following:Contextual InterpretationRecognizes the historical,
                cultural, and literary context of each verse (2 Peter 1:20-21,
                Matthew 4:4).Thematic HarmonyAligns verses with overarching
                biblical themes, such as divine inspiration, Christ-centered
                revelation, and moral guidance (Luke 24:27, Isaiah
                55:11).Multi-Sense ApproachIncorporates the four classical
                senses of Scripture:Literal: Plain meaning of the text (2
                Timothy 3:16).Allegorical: Symbolism pointing to Christ (Luke
                24:27).Moral: Ethical teachings and life application (James
                1:22).Anagogical: Spiritual or eschatological significance
                (Revelation 21:5).Spirit-Guided DiscernmentEmphasizes reliance
                on the Holy Spirit for understanding and avoiding
                misinterpretation (1 Corinthians 2:13, 2 Peter 3:16).</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Original Sin</h1>
              <p><strong>Universal Human Depravity and Divine Redemption</strong></p>
              <p>Inherited Guilt (Federal Headship)Core Concept: Adam, as the
                representative (federal head) of humanity, bore responsibility
                for the initial disobedience that introduced sin into the world.
                His guilt is imputed to all humanity.Key Verses:Romans 5:12-19:
                "By one man's disobedience the many were made sinners."1
                Corinthians 15:22: "As in Adam all die."Ezekiel 18:20: "The soul
                who sins shall die" (emphasizing personal responsibility
                alongside inherited guilt).2. Inherited Sinful Nature (Total
                Depravity)Core Concept: Humans inherit a corrupted nature from
                Adam, inclining them toward sin in every aspect of their being.
                This does not imply absolute depravity but an inability to
                achieve righteousness on their own.Key Verses:Psalm 51:5: "I was
                brought forth in iniquity."Jeremiah 17:9: "The heart is
                deceitful above all things."Romans 3:10-12: "None is righteous,
                no, not one."3. Personal Responsibility for SinCore Concept:
                Though humanity inherits a sinful nature and guilt, individuals
                are responsible for their personal sins and moral choices.Key
                Verses:Ezekiel 18:20: "The son shall not suffer for the iniquity
                of the father."James 4:17: "Whoever knows the right thing to do
                and fails to do it, for him it is sin."4. Separation from
                GodCore Concept: Sin causes a spiritual and relational
                separation between humanity and God, necessitating divine
                reconciliation.Key Verses:Isaiah 59:2: "Your iniquities have
                made a separation between you and your God."Romans 6:23: "The
                wages of sin is death."5. Universal Need for RedemptionCore
                Concept: Redemption is necessary because all are guilty before
                God and incapable of self-salvation.Key Verses:Romans 3:23: "For
                all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."Romans 5:8:
                "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."John 3:16:
                "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son."6.
                Victory and Transformation Through ChristCore Concept: Christ’s
                atoning work provides both justification from guilt and
                sanctification from sin's power, enabling believers to live in
                righteousness.Key Verses:Romans 8:1-2: "There is therefore now
                no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."2 Corinthians
                5:21: "For our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no
                sin."Doctrine Espoused:This framework aligns with the doctrine
                of Original Sin in its dual emphasis on inherited guilt (federal
                headship) and the corrupted sinful nature (total depravity).
                Additionally, it incorporates aspects of personal responsibility
                and emphasizes the necessity of redemption through Christ,
                consistent with both Augustinian and Reformed theological
                traditions.<strong><br>

              and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."1

              is imperishable."3. Judgment and RewardCore Concept: All people
              will stand before the judgment seat of Christ to receive eternal

              culminating in Christ’s victory over evil.Key Verses:Matthew
              24:21: "For then there will be great tribulation."Revelation

              3:1-5: "In the last days there will come times of difficulty."5.
              Millennial Reign of ChristCore Concept: Jesus will reign for a
              thousand years, a period of peace and justice, followed by the
              final defeat of Satan and the establishment of the eternal
              kingdom.Key Verses:Revelation 20:1-6: "They came to life and
              reigned with Christ for a thousand years."Daniel 7:14: "His
              dominion is an everlasting dominion."6. New Heavens and New
              EarthCore Concept: God will create a renewed, eternal dwelling
              place where His people will experience His presence, joy, and
              peace forever.Key Verses:Isaiah 65:17-25: "Behold, I create new
              heavens and a new earth."Revelation 21:1-4: "He will wipe away
              every tear...death shall be no more."7. Call to Watchfulness and
              HopeCore Concept: Believers are called to live in readiness,
              holiness, and hope, eagerly awaiting the fulfillment of God’s
              promises.Key Verses:Matthew 24:36: "Concerning that day and hour
              no one knows."Titus 2:13: "Waiting for our blessed hope, the
              appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior."2 Peter 3:10:
              "The day of the Lord will come like a thief."

              <h1 id="introduction">Communion (Eucharist)</h1>
              (c) Symbolic: 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 suggests remembrance of
              Christ through bread and wine.
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Tradition</h1>
              (b) Secondary to Scripture: Jesus often criticizes human
              traditions (Mark 7:8).
              <h1 id="introduction">Just War Theory</h1>
              <p>(a) Just war permissible: Romans 13:4 speaks of government as
                an avenger to carry out God's wrath on wrongdoers.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Creation</h1>
              (a) Young Earth Creationism: New Testament supports Genesis
              creation accounts (e.g., Mark 10:6).</div>
            <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;">
              <h1 id="introduction">Gender Roles in Church</h1>
              <p>(a) Complementarianism: 1 Timothy 2:12-14 outlines distinct
                roles for men and women in teaching.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Saints and Intercession</h1>
              <p>(c) No veneration: 1 Timothy 2:5 declares Christ as the sole
                mediator.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Sin and Atonement</h1>
              <p>(a) Penal substitution: Romans 5:8-9 highlights Christ’s death
                as atonement for sin.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Mission and Evangelism</h1>
              (a) Mandatory for all believers: The Great Commission in Matthew
              28:19 applies universally.
              <h1 id="introduction">Holy Spirit</h1>
              <p>(a) Equal to the Father and Son: John 14:26 describes the Holy
                Spirit as the Advocate sent by the Father.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Miracles and Gifts of the Spirit</h1>
              <p>(a) Active today: 1 Corinthians 12 discusses the ongoing
                operation of spiritual gifts.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Clergy and Ordination</h1>
              <p>(b) Restricted to men: 1 Timothy 3:2-4 sets qualifications for
                male overseers.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of the Law (Old Testament)</h1>
              <p>(b) Partially applicable: Galatians 3:24 describes the law as a
                guardian until Christ.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Christian Unity</h1>
              <p>(b) Based on shared faith in Christ: Ephesians 4:4-6 emphasizes
                unity in one Lord, faith, and baptism.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Works in Christian Life</h1>
              <p>(b) Evidence of faith: James 2:26 states faith without works is
                dead.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Divorce and Remarriage</h1>
              <p>(b) Permitted in specific cases: Matthew 19:9 permits divorce
                in cases of sexual immorality.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction" style="text-align: left;">Ethical Teachings
                (e.g., Sermon on the Mount)</h1>
              <p>(a) To be taken literally: Jesus commands literal application
                of principles like loving enemies (Matthew 5:44).</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Religious Icons and Imagery</h1>
              <p>(c) Prohibited: Acts 17:29 critiques reliance on material
                depictions of the divine.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Fasting</h1>
              <p>(b) Optional but beneficial: Matthew 6:16-18 describes fasting
                as a private, voluntary act.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Marriage</h1>
              <p>(a) A sacrament: Ephesians 5:31-32 compares marriage to Christ
                and the Church.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Confession</h1>
              <p>(b) Directly to God only: 1 John 1:9 advocates confession of
                sins directly to God.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Purgatory</h1>
              <p>(b) Nonexistent: No explicit New Testament reference supports
                purgatory.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Angels and Demons</h1>
              <p>(a) Actively involved in human affairs: Hebrews 1:14 describes
                angels as ministering spirits.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Ecumenism</h1>
              (b) Helpful but secondary: John 17:21 prays for unity but centers
              on Christ.</div>
            <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;"><br>
              <h1 id="introduction">Role of Israel in Theology</h1>
              (b) Israel retains a distinct role: Romans 11 discusses the
              salvation of Israel.</div>
            <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143; text-align: justify;"><br>
              <h1 id="introduction">Nature of the Church</h1>
              <p>(c) Both visible and invisible: 1 Corinthians 12 describes a
                universal, spiritual body.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Heavenly Rewards</h1>
              <p>(b) Based on faith and works: 2 Corinthians 5:10 mentions
                rewards according to deeds.</p>
              <h1 id="introduction">Human Nature Post-Fall</h1>
              <p>(b) Partially corrupted: Romans 3:23 acknowledges universal
                sin, but redemption is offered through Christ.</p>
