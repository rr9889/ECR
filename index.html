      <h1>Celeberations</h1>
      Christianity (before A.D. 325) was marked by its simplicity and focus on
      key events from the life of Jesus Christ and the practices of the early
      Church. The celebrations were primarily spiritual, deeply communal, and
      often linked to Jewish traditions that the early Christians inherited and
      adapted.<br><br>The writings sourcing 1st and 2nd-century Christian 
		celebrations are drawn from The Didache (c. 100 A.D.), Tertullian's De 
		Corona (c. 197 A.D.), Tertullian's Apologeticus (c. 197 A.D.), 
		Hippolytus' Apostolic Tradition (c. 215 A.D.), Ignatius of Antioch's 
		Letter to the Smyrnaeans (c. 110 A.D.), Irenaeus' Against Heresies (c. 
		180 A.D.), Pliny's Epistles (c. 112 A.D.), The Martyrdom of Polycarp (c. 
		156 A.D.), and the New Testament and Old Testament.<strong><br></strong>&nbsp;<h1 class="auto-style1">The Lord's Day</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">Every Sunday</span></em></p>
      The Lord's Day is explicitly identified as Sunday, the "first day of the
      week," established by early Christians to commemorate Jesus' resurrection.
      This practice emerged because Sunday was the day of Jesus’ resurrection
      (Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2), and early writers like Ignatius of
      Antioch and Justin Martyr explained that it replaced the Jewish Sabbath
      (Saturday), symbolizing the new covenant and creation. On this day,
      Christians gathered for communal worship, which included reading
      scripture, prayers (eg. Lord's Prayer), and hymns. They also celebrated
      the Eucharist, sharing bread and wine to remember Christ’s sacrifice, made
      offerings to support the poor and their community, and fostered fellowship
      to strengthen unity, particularly during persecution. Sunday, often called 
		the "eighth day," marked new creation and redemption, becoming central 
		to Christian identity and joyfully replacing the Sabbath. It was 
		observed in homes, catacombs, or secret locations due to persecution, as 
		suggested by early accounts like Pliny’s Epistles (10.96), which 
		describe Christians meeting in private before dawn to avoid detection.<br>
		<h1><strong><span class="auto-style1">Pascha</span></strong> </h1>
		<p><span class="auto-style3">20</span><em><span class="auto-style3"> 
		April 2025 and 5 April 2026</span></em></p>
		<p>Pascha or Easter was the central celebration of Pre-Nicene 
		Christianity, commemorating Jesus’ passion, death, and resurrection as 
		the fulfillment of the Jewish Passover. All four Gospels affirm that 
		Jesus' resurrection took place on the first day of the week, which is 
		Sunday (Matthew 28:1-10, Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-12, John 20:1-18).</p>
		<p>The 1st and 2nd-century Christian consensus, as seen in Irenaeus 
		(Against Heresies, Book 5) and Hippolytus (The Apostolic Tradition, c. 
		215 A.D.), holds that Easter (Pascha) is celebrated on the Sunday 
		following the 14th of Nisan, the first Sunday after the full moon 
		following the vernal equinox. Pope Anicetus of Rome supported this 
		practice, aligning with the Roman tradition of observing Easter on 
		Sunday rather than the 14th of Nisan (Irenaeus, Against Heresies, Book 
		3, Chapter 3).</p>
		<p>This date makes it distinct from the Jewish Passover (Pesach), which 
		occurs on the 14th of Nisan. Polycarp of Smyrna and Melito of Sardis, 
		both bishops in Asia Minor, advocated for celebrating Easter on the 14th 
		of Nisan, aligning it with the Jewish Passover.</p>
		<p>Pascha (Easter) emphasized Christ’s victory over sin and death, 
		symbolizing the new creation and hope for Christians (Irenaeus, <em>
		Against Heresies</em>, Book 5). Christians prepared for this celebration 
		through fasting and catechesis, typically lasting 1-2 days (Hippolytus,
		<em>The Apostolic Tradition</em>, c. 215 A.D.). The occasion was marked 
		by nighttime vigils, scripture readings, prayers, and a sunrise 
		Eucharist, all reflecting the triumph of the resurrection (Tertullian,
		<em>De Corona</em>, Chapter 3). The event also symbolized renewal and 
		hope, as believers celebrated Christ’s resurrection as the foundation of 
		new life (Irenaeus, <em>Against Heresies</em>, Book 5). Communal meals 
		and hymns highlighted unity and joy within the Christian community (The 
		Didache, Chapters 9-10).</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1">Pentecost</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">1 June 2025 and 21 May 2026</span></em></p>
		<p>Pentecost, celebrated fifty days after Pascha, marked the descent of 
		the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as described in Acts 2, where the 
		Spirit enabled them to speak in various languages, leading to the 
		conversion of about 3,000 people (Acts 2:1–4, 41). This event signified 
		the beginning of the Church’s mission to spread the gospel universally 
		and was seen as the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy about God pouring out 
		His Spirit on all people (Acts 2:16–21; Joel 2:28–32).</p>
		<p>Pre-A.D. 325, Pentecost was observed as a day of worship and 
		reflection, with Christians gathering for communal prayer, scripture 
		readings, and breaking of bread (Acts 2:42). The Eucharist held a 
		central place in these gatherings, symbolizing the unity of believers 
		and their shared faith in Christ. Preaching likely focused on the role 
		of the Holy Spirit in empowering the Church and spreading the gospel.</p>
		<p>The Book of Acts suggests that baptisms were integral to Pentecost 
		celebrations, as the Spirit's outpouring was closely associated with 
		repentance and baptism (Acts 2:38–41). Fellowship and communal sharing 
		were also emphasized, as believers shared meals and resources, 
		strengthening their unity and commitment to one another (Acts 2:44–46).</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1">Martyrs' Commemorations</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">Earthly death date of the martyr</span></em></p>
		<p>Early Christians honored those who were killed for their faith, 
		believing that martyrs entered eternal life on the day of their death, 
		which was seen as their "heavenly birthday." Anniversaries of the 
		martyrs’ deaths were observed annually, often coinciding with their 
		execution dates. These commemorations celebrated the martyrs' unwavering 
		faith, their sacrifice for Christ, and the hope of resurrection. 
		Gatherings took place at the martyrs’ burial sites, such as in catacombs 
		or marked graves, where Christians prayed, celebrated the Eucharist, and 
		shared the stories of the martyrs to inspire courage and perseverance in 
		their community. Stories like those of Polycarp of Smyrna and Ignatius 
		of Antioch were read aloud. Commemorations sometimes included shared 
		meals, reinforcing fellowship and remembrance of the martyrs’ example. 
		These meals are linked to the Eucharist, focusing on Christ’s sacrifice 
		and the martyrs' unity with Him.</p>
		<p><em>“The blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church.”</em> 
		(Tertullian. <em>Apologeticus</em>. Translated c. 197. Chapter 50.)</p>
		<p>"<em>...The Lord shall grant us to celebrate the anniversary of his 
		martyrdom, both in memory of those who have already finished their 
		course, and for the exercising and preparation of those yet to walk in 
		their steps."</em> (Smyrnaeans. c. 156. <em>The Martyrdom of Polycarp</em>. 
		Chapter 18.)</p>
		<p>The Bible honors martyrs as faithful witnesses with a special place 
		in God’s kingdom. Revelation 6:9–11 and 20:4 affirm their heavenly 
		reward, while Jesus blesses the persecuted in Matthew 5:10–12 and urges 
		courage in Matthew 10:28. Stephen’s martyrdom in Acts 7:54–60 models 
		forgiveness and faith, forming a strong biblical basis for commemorating 
		their sacrifice.</p>
		<p>In the Bible, martyrs are honored as faithful witnesses with a 
		special place in God’s kingdom, as affirmed in Revelation 6:9–11 and 
		Revelation 20:4, while Matthew 5:10–12 and Matthew 10:28 bless those 
		persecuted for righteousness and encourage courage in the face of death. 
		Early Christian martyrs, including Stephen (stoned, Acts 7:54–60), 
		James, Son of Zebedee (beheaded, Acts 12:1–2), and Antipas (martyred, 
		Revelation 2:13), exemplify the sacrifices made for the faith. The 
		apostles also faced martyrdom in various ways: Peter (crucified), Paul 
		(beheaded), Andrew (crucified), Thomas (speared), Philip (crucified), 
		Matthew (martyred), Bartholomew (flayed and beheaded), James, Son of 
		Alphaeus (stoned or sawn in half), Thaddeus (martyred), Simon the Zealot 
		(crucified), and Matthias (stoned and beheaded). Early Christian leaders 
		like Polycarp of Smyrna (burned alive) and Ignatius of Antioch (eaten by 
		wild beasts).</p>
		<p>The early Christian community would have likely observed approxmitely 
		20-25 annual celebrations of martyrs.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1">Agape Feasts</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">No fixed date, a flexible practice, or 
		tied to other Chrisitan events</span></em></p>
		<p>The Agape Feast was a communal meal regularly celebrated by all 
		members of the Christian community, including the poor and marginalized, 
		often in conjunction with the Eucharist. These gatherings took place in 
		homes or meeting spaces, where participants shared food and resources, 
		reflecting Jesus’ teachings on generosity and care for others. The meals 
		emphasized unity, charity, and Christ’s love, ensuring the needs of all 
		were met and reinforcing equality within the Church. While initially 
		linked to the Eucharist, abuses like those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 
		11:20–22 led to their separation over time. Through acts of mutual care, 
		the Agape Feast fostered a deep sense of community and charity among 
		early Christians.</p>
		<p>The Agape Feasts are rooted in Jude 12, which directly references 
		"love feasts" as communal meals among Christians. Acts 2:46 describes 
		believers breaking bread in homes with joy and unity, while 1 
		Corinthians 11:20–22 critiques their misuse, calling for equality in 
		such gatherings.</p>
		<p>The Didache (Chapters 9–10) outlines shared meals connected to 
		prayers and thanksgiving, and Tertullian (<em>Apology</em> 39) 
		highlights them as acts of charity and fellowship for the poor. These 
		sources establish the Agape Feasts as communal meals emphasizing unity, 
		charity, and worship.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1">Baptism</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">No fixed date, could be standalone 
		event, or tied to other Christian events</span></em></p>
		<p>In the 1st and 2nd centuries, baptism was both a standalone event 
		and, at times, part of a larger celebration, depending on the context.</p>
		<p>Biblically, in the New Testament, baptism is closely linked to 
		immediate conversion and repentance, with new converts often baptized 
		shortly after accepting the faith (Acts 2:38, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 9:18, 
		Acts 16:30-33). Baptism is presented as a standalone event associated 
		with repentance, forgiveness, and the receiving of the Holy Spirit 
		(e.g., Acts 2:38, Acts 8:36-38).</p>
		<p>Early 1st-century Christian texts, such as the Didache, show that 
		baptism often occurred alongside other rites like fasting and prayers 
		but was also emphasized as a distinct event. Tertullian and Ignatius 
		indicate that while baptism was a key act of Christian initiation, it 
		was sometimes celebrated alongside the Eucharist but could also stand on 
		its own (Tertullian, <em>De Baptismo</em>, Chapter 1; Ignatius of 
		Antioch, <em>Letter to the Ephesians</em>, Chapter 20). Thus, while 
		baptism was essential for Christian initiation, early Christian 
		communities sometimes celebrated it in conjunction with other rites, 
		such as the Eucharist, especially during larger gatherings or special 
		occasions like Pentecost.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1">Lenten</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">Wednesdays and Fridays</span></em></p>
		<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Fasting in preparation for major feasts like 
		Easter (Pascha) is mentioned in early Christian writings, particularly 
		the Didache (c. 100 A.D.). The Didache (Chapters 8-9) provides clear 
		instructions on fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, which were seen as 
		days of penance and preparation for Christian worship and communion. 
		They were part of the early Christian discipline of preparing 
		spiritually for the celebration of the Eucharist. The Didache emphasizes 
		that fasting should be done in a manner that sets Christians apart from 
		the practices of the Pharisees and hypocrites, suggesting a more 
		spiritual and humble approach to fasting. This practice of fasting on 
		Wednesdays and Fridays was widespread in early Christianity, with many 
		Christian communities (Rome, Alexandria, and Asia Minor, Syria, North 
		Africa) adopting it as a regular form of penance, spiritual reflection, 
		and preparation for worship" (Didache, Chapters 8-9; Tertullian, <em>De 
		Corona</em>, Chapter 3; Clement of Alexandria, <em>Stromata</em>, Book 
		3, Chapter 2).</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1" data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Catechesis and 
		Instruction</h1>
		<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []"><em><span class="auto-style3">No fixed date, 
		solely to be done pre-baptismal</span></em></p>
		<p>In the Didache (c. 100 A.D.), "teaching" or "instruction" (didachē) 
		refers to the moral guidance for new converts before baptism. In 
		Hippolytus' Apostolic Tradition (c. 215 A.D.), the term "catechesis" 
		(catechēseis) is used more formally for pre-baptismal instruction, 
		focusing on Christian doctrine, confession, and ethical practices.</p>
		<p>Early Christian catechesis was closely tied to baptism, serving as 
		the foundational preparation for new converts. The Didache (c. 100 A.D.) 
		provides basic instructions for baptizing new believers, including the 
		essential elements of faith and moral conduct that candidates needed to 
		demonstrate before baptism. It emphasizes the importance of teaching the 
		commands of Jesus, and lays out a structure for pre-baptismal 
		instruction, with particular focus on ethical living and adherence to 
		Christian principles.</p>
		<p>The Apostolic Tradition by Hippolytus (c. 215 A.D.) offers a more 
		formalized and detailed approach to catechetical instruction, especially 
		in the context of Christian initiation through baptism. Hippolytus 
		outlines a thorough process where candidates undergo significant 
		preparation for baptism, including confession of faith, instruction on 
		Christian living, and moral teachings. His work also emphasizes the 
		laying on of hands after baptism, marking the receipt of the Holy 
		Spirit, further solidifying the initiation process. This catechesis was 
		critical to ensuring that converts were fully grounded in the Christian 
		faith and ready to join the community of believers through baptism.</p>
		<p>Thus, in early Christianity, catechesis and baptism were inseparable, 
		as baptism represented the culmination of one's spiritual preparation 
		and entrance into the Christian community.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style1">Ancillary Activities</h1>
		<p><em><span class="auto-style3">No fixed date, as needed basis</span></em></p>
		<p>Early Christians engaged in various ancillary activities within their 
		communities that extended beyond formal worship and included teaching, 
		study, fellowship, and acts of charity. These gatherings often took 
		place in house churches, where believers came together for scripture 
		readings, prayer, and Eucharistic celebrations. The Didache (c. 100 
		A.D.) outlines a broader communal lifestyle, encouraging activities like 
		prayer, fasting, baptism, and teachings.</p>
		<p>Scripture passages, such as Acts 2:42-47, describe early Christian 
		communities as being devoted to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, 
		breaking of bread, and prayer, suggesting that house-to-house gatherings 
		were essential for both communal worship and spiritual education.</p>
		<p>Paul’s letters further highlight the role of house churches in 
		Christian teaching and fellowship. In Romans 16:5, he greets the church 
		in Priscilla and Aquila's house, indicating that these gatherings were 
		centers for study and community building. Similarly, 1 Corinthians 16:19 
		and Colossians 4:15 refer to house gatherings as important spaces for 
		fellowship and teaching among early believers. These early house 
		churches provided opportunities for Christian instruction, including 
		Bible study, where believers could gather for teaching, mutual 
		encouragement, and growth in faith.</p>
		<p>Acts of charity were deeply rooted in both New Testament teachings 
		and the practices of the 1st and 2nd-century church. Biblically, the 
		Acts of the Apostles highlights the foundational Christian principle of 
		shared resources for the welfare of the community. Acts 2:44-45 
		describes how early Christians sold their possessions to meet the needs 
		of others, emphasizing that generosity and unity were core elements of 
		Christian life (Acts 2:44-45). Similarly, in Acts 4:32-34, believers 
		continued this practice of communal sharing, with figures like Barnabas 
		donating land for the poor (Acts 4:32-34). Additionally, 1 Corinthians 
		16:1-2 and Galatians 2:10 further demonstrate that charitable 
		collections were an integral, structured part of early Christian life, 
		where Christians were called to set aside funds to support those in 
		need, particularly the poor in Jerusalem (1 Corinthians 16:1-2, 
		Galatians 2:10).</p>
		<p>The Didache (c. 100 A.D.), a key early Christian text, reflects this 
		principle by instructing Christians to give to the poor in accordance 
		with God’s commands, advocating for generosity and secret charity 
		(Didache, Chapter 1). Early writers like Tertullian (c. 197 A.D.) 
		highlight how Christian charity was widely recognized, noting that 
		Christians were known for their care for the poor, including orphans, 
		widows, and prisoners (Tertullian, <em>Apologeticus</em>, Chapter 39). 
		Ignatius of Antioch (c. 110 A.D.) also emphasized charity, urging the 
		faithful to support church leaders and those persecuted for their faith 
		(Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Smyrnaeans</em>, Chapter 8).</p>
		<p>In the 1st and 2nd centuries, acts of charity were not just social 
		duties but expressions of Christian love and solidarity. Generosity 
		towards the poor, support for church leaders, and assistance during 
		persecution were foundational aspects of early Christian life. These 
		acts were seen as practical manifestations of the gospel and covenantal 
		living in a world where many believers faced economic hardships or 
		persecution for their faith.</p>
