      <h1>Cross on Forehead</h1>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">The practice of making the sign of the
        cross dates back to the early centuries of Christianity, with its
        earliest origins traceable to around the year 200. In Carthage
        (modern-day Tunisia, Africa), Tertullian wrote, "At every forward step
        and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and
        shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on
        couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon
        the forehead the sign [of the cross]" (De Corona, ch. 3) He also noted,
        "We Christians wear out our foreheads with the sign of the cross,"
        noting its frequent use as a symbol of faith and protection. Around the
        same time, Hippolytus of Rome, in his Apostolic Tradition, recommended
        tracing the cross on the forehead during times of temptation, referring
        to it as the "Sign of the Passion" </div>

        <h1 id="icon">Rising Hands</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The practice of raising hands in worship
          originates in the Old Testament. In Genesis 29:35, Leah raises her
          hands in praise to YHWH when naming Judah. The Hebrew word YaDaH
          (Strong's #3034), meaning "praise," "thank," or "confess," comes from
          YaD (Strong's #3027), meaning "hand," linking the gesture to worship.
          Raising hands appears throughout Scripture as an act of devotion. In
          Exodus 17:11, Moses lifts his hands during battle, and Israel
          prevails. In Nehemiah 8:6, the people lift their hands while saying
          "Amen." The Psalms often mention this gesture: Psalm 63:4 ties it to
          blessing, and Psalm 141:2 compares it to an offering. Lamentations
          2:19 and 3:41 depict hands raised in prayer and repentance.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="ir">Infants Requirements?</h2>
          <p class="ir">The Early Church Fathers addressed how infants, unable
            to consciously repent, express faith, or fast, could meet baptismal
            requirements. They argued that infants inherit original sin (Psalm
            51:5, Romans 5:12) and require baptism for its remission, even
            without personal repentance. Cyprian of Carthage (c. 200–258 AD)
            asserted that infants, though sinless in action, should not be
            denied baptism: "If remission of sins is granted even to the worst
            sinners, how much more should an infant not be held back, who has
            done no sin" (*Letters*, 64:2).</p>
          <p class="ir">Regarding faith, the Fathers taught that infants could
            receive baptism through the faith of their parents or the Church.
            Origen (c. 184–253 AD) stated that infant baptism was an apostolic
            tradition: "The Church received from the apostles the tradition of
            giving baptism even to infants" (*Commentary on Romans*, Book V, 9).
            Hippolytus of Rome (c. 170–235 AD) instructed that parents or
            relatives should speak for infants during baptism if the child could
            not (*Apostolic Tradition*, 21).</p>
          <p class="ir">Fasting before baptism, required for older candidates,
            was not expected of infants. Instead, sponsors or parents fasted on
            their behalf. The *Didache* (late 1st or early 2nd century) mentions
            fasting for baptismal candidates but does not specify infants,
            implying their exemption.</p>
          <p class="ir">The Fathers also linked baptism to circumcision
            (Colossians 2:11-12), viewing it as the New Covenant inclusion of
            infants. Irenaeus of Lyons (c. 130–202 AD) emphasized Christ’s
            salvation for all, including infants: "He came to save all through
            Himself—infants, children, youths, and old men" (*Against Heresies*,
            Book II, 22.4).</p>
          <p class="ir">Sponsors (godparents) played a key role, acting on
            behalf of infants who could not fulfill baptismal requirements
            themselves. Tertullian (c. 160–220 AD) and Hippolytus both
            acknowledged this practice, with Hippolytus explicitly instructing
            parents or relatives to speak for infants during baptism. </p>

            <blockquote>"Therefore, considering each person’s situation,
              character, and even age, it is better to delay baptism—especially
              in the case of young children. Why rush to baptize them if baptism
              itself is not an urgent necessity? Doing so also places the
              sponsors (godparents) at risk, as they may fail to keep their
              promises due to death or be let down if the child grows up to live
              a life contrary to the faith. After all, the Lord said, 'Do not
              hinder them from coming to me.' So let them come to Christ as they
              grow older, as they learn, and as they come to understand what it
              means to follow Him. Let them become Christians when they are
              capable of knowing Christ for themselves. Why should the innocence
              of childhood be hurried into seeking the 'remission of sins'? We
              are more cautious in worldly matters—why would we entrust divine
              things to those we wouldn’t even trust with earthly
              responsibilities? Let them first learn to seek salvation for
              themselves, so that when they ask, it can truly be said that you
              have given 'to the one who asks.'"</blockquote>

        <h2 class="con">Infant Mortality Rate</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> The expansion of the Christian
          community in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, along with the inclusion of
          families, significantly influenced the normalization of infant
          baptism. High child mortality rates further motivated parents to seek
          baptism for their children's spiritual security. Everett Ferguson
          argues that while there is no firm evidence for infant baptism before
          the late second century, its origins likely lie in the emergency
          baptism of sick children expected to die soon. <sup><span class="ref">REF<span
                class="ref-box"> Ferguson, E. (2009). <em>Baptism in the Early
                  Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy in the First Five

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> In <em>A Woman’s Place: House Churches
            in Early Christianity</em>, Osiek and MacDonald highlight the high
          risks of infection during childbirth, as noted in Pliny the Elder’s <em>Natural
            History</em>. They also report that approximately 30% of infants
          died in their first year, reflecting the high infant mortality rates
          of the time. <sup><span class="ref">REF<span class="ref-box"> Osiek,
                C., &amp; MacDonald, M. (2006). <em>A Woman's Place: House

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Historical evidence supports this
          perspective, notably Cyprian's advocacy for baptizing infants without
          delay and the practice of emergency baptisms for gravely ill children.
          This practice reflected the early Christian community's concern for
          ensuring the salvation of vulnerable infants. <sup><span class="ref">REF<span
                class="ref-box"> Cyprian of Carthage, Epistle 64 (c. 250 CE). </span></span></sup>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> David F. Wright builds on this,
          suggesting that infant baptism became more widespread following
          Augustine's theological emphasis on the necessity of baptism for
          salvation, particularly in light of original sin. <sup><span class="ref">REF<span

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> Finally, Francesco Arduini connects the
          practice to historical crises like the Antonine Plague, which
          heightened fears of child mortality and accelerated the adoption of
          infant baptism as a protective rite. <sup><span class="ref">REF<span

        <p></p>
        <h2 class="con">Conclusion</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">While the 1st century lacks explicit
          evidence of infant baptism, the practice became well-established by
          the 2nd and 3rd centuries, supported by historical records and
          theological arguments from Early Church Fathers. Biblical passages
          referencing household baptisms (e.g., Acts 16:15, 33) suggest infants
          and children were likely baptized with adults. Figures like Irenaeus,
          Origen, and Cyprian affirmed infant baptism as apostolic tradition,
          emphasizing its role in forgiving original sin and integrating infants
          into the covenant community. Theologically, the Church Fathers
          addressed concerns about infants' inability to repent or express faith
          by arguing that the faith of the Church or parents could substitute
          for the child’s personal faith. They also likened baptism to
          circumcision in the Old Covenant, which included infants. By the 3rd
          century, archaeological evidence, such as small baptismal fonts and
          catacomb inscriptions, further confirms the practice. In summary,
          infant baptism was viewed by the Early Church as essential for the
          salvation and inclusion of infants in the Christian community.</p>
