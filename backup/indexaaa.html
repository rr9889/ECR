      <p>Christianity in its earliest centuries (before A.D. 325) was marked by simplicity, deep spirituality, and a strong communal focus. Rooted in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, the early Church adapted Jewish traditions to reflect the new covenant, creating practices that were profound expressions of faith, unity, and hope, often carried out under persecution.</p>
      <p>This exploration draws from 1st and 2nd-century writings, including The Didache (c. 100 A.D.), Tertullian’s De Corona and Apologeticus (c. 197 A.D.), Hippolytus’ Apostolic Tradition (c. 215 A.D.), Ignatius of Antioch’s Letter to the Smyrnaeans (c. 110 A.D.), Irenaeus’ Against Heresies (c. 180 A.D.), Pliny’s Epistles (c. 112 A.D.), The Martyrdom of Polycarp (c. 156 A.D.), and the New Testament. These sources reveal the spiritual life of early Christians, their celebrations, and their unwavering commitment to Christ.</p>
      <p>From the weekly Lord’s Day to the annual Pascha (Easter), and from communal Agape Feasts to the solemn commemorations of martyrs, early Christian practices were deeply rooted in Scripture. They fostered unity, spiritual growth, and witness to the world, laying the foundation for centuries of Christian worship and community life.</p>
      <p>This introduction highlights how early Christians lived out their faith in a hostile world, demonstrating the transformative power of the gospel through celebrations, fasting, teaching, and acts of charity.</p>

<p>The Agape Feast was a communal meal regularly celebrated by all members of the Christian community, including the poor and marginalized, often in conjunction with the Eucharist. These gatherings took place in homes or meeting spaces, where participants shared food and resources, reflecting Jesus’ teachings on generosity and care for others. The meals emphasized unity, charity, and Christ’s love, ensuring the needs of all were met and reinforcing equality within the Church. While initially linked to the Eucharist, abuses like those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 11:20–22 led to their separation over time. Through acts of mutual care, the Agape Feast fostered a deep sense of community and charity among early Christians.</p>

<p>The Agape Feasts are rooted in Jude 12, which directly references "love feasts" as communal meals among Christians. Acts 2:46 describes believers breaking bread in homes with joy and unity, while 1 Corinthians 11:20–22 critiques their misuse, calling for equality in such gatherings.</p>

<p>The Didache (Chapters 9–10) outlines shared meals connected to prayers and thanksgiving, and Tertullian (<em>Apology</em> 39) highlights them as acts of charity and fellowship for the poor. These sources establish the Agape Feasts as communal meals emphasizing unity, charity, and worship.</p>

  <p>Early Christians extended their faith beyond formal worship through teaching, fellowship, and charity, often gathering in house churches for scripture readings, prayer, and Eucharist (<em>Didache</em> 9–10; Acts 2:42–47).</p>
  <p>Paul’s letters highlight house churches as centers for study, fellowship, and worship, where believers gathered for teaching, prayer, and communal meals (Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:19).</p>
  <p>Acts of charity, such as sharing resources and supporting the poor, were central to the communal life of early Christians. They sold possessions to meet the needs of others and collected funds to support those in need, reflecting their commitment to unity and generosity (Acts 2:44–45, 4:32–34; 1 Corinthians 16:1–2).</p>
  <p>Early Christian texts, such as the Didache and the writings of Tertullian and Ignatius of Antioch, emphasize generosity and care for the vulnerable as essential expressions of Christian love and solidarity (<em>Didache</em> 1:5–6; Tertullian, <em>Apologeticus</em> 39; Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Smyrnaeans</em> 8).</p>

<p>In the 1st and 2nd centuries, baptism was both a standalone event and, at times, part of a larger celebration, depending on the context.</p>

<p>Biblically, in the New Testament, baptism is closely linked to immediate conversion and repentance, with new converts often baptized shortly after accepting the faith (Acts 2:38, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 9:18, Acts 16:30-33). Baptism is presented as a standalone event associated with repentance, forgiveness, and the receiving of the Holy Spirit (e.g., Acts 2:38, Acts 8:36-38).</p>

<p>Early 1st-century Christian texts, such as the Didache, show that baptism often occurred alongside other rites like fasting and prayers but was also emphasized as a distinct event. Tertullian and Ignatius indicate that while baptism was a key act of Christian initiation, it was sometimes celebrated alongside the Eucharist but could also stand on its own (Tertullian, <em>De Baptismo</em>, Chapter 1; Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Ephesians</em>, Chapter 20). Thus, while baptism was essential for Christian initiation, early Christian communities sometimes celebrated it in conjunction with other rites, such as the Eucharist, especially during larger gatherings or special occasions like Pentecost.</p>

<p>In the Didache (c. 100 A.D.), "teaching" or "instruction" (didachē) refers to the moral guidance for new converts before baptism. In Hippolytus' Apostolic Tradition (c. 215 A.D.), the term "catechesis" (catechēseis) is used more formally for pre-baptismal instruction, focusing on Christian doctrine, confession, and ethical practices.</p>

<p>Early Christian catechesis was closely tied to baptism, serving as the foundational preparation for new converts. The Didache (c. 100 A.D.) provides basic instructions for baptizing new believers, including the essential elements of faith and moral conduct that candidates needed to demonstrate before baptism. It emphasizes the importance of teaching the commands of Jesus and lays out a structure for pre-baptismal instruction, with particular focus on ethical living and adherence to Christian principles.</p>

<p>The Apostolic Tradition by Hippolytus (c. 215 A.D.) offers a more formalized and detailed approach to catechetical instruction, especially in the context of Christian initiation through baptism. Hippolytus outlines a thorough process where candidates undergo significant preparation for baptism, including confession of faith, instruction on Christian living, and moral teachings. His work also emphasizes the laying on of hands after baptism, marking the receipt of the Holy Spirit, further solidifying the initiation process. This catechesis was critical to ensuring that converts were fully grounded in the Christian faith and ready to join the community of believers through baptism.</p>

<p>Thus, in early Christianity, catechesis and baptism were inseparable, as baptism represented the culmination of one's spiritual preparation and entrance into the Christian community.</p>

<p>Fasting in preparation for major feasts like Easter (Pascha) is mentioned in early Christian writings, particularly the Didache (c. 100 A.D.). The Didache (Chapters 8-9) provides clear instructions on fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, which were seen as days of penance and preparation for Christian worship and communion. They were part of the early Christian discipline of preparing spiritually for the celebration of the Eucharist. The Didache emphasizes that fasting should be done in a manner that sets Christians apart from the practices of the Pharisees and hypocrites, suggesting a more spiritual and humble approach to fasting. This practice of fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays was widespread in early Christianity, with many Christian communities (Rome, Alexandria, and Asia Minor, Syria, North Africa) adopting it as a regular form of penance, spiritual reflection, and preparation for worship (Didache, Chapters 8-9; Tertullian, <em>De Corona</em>, Chapter 3; Clement of Alexandria, <em>Stromata</em>, Book 3, Chapter 2).</p>

<div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
  <p>Early Christians honored martyrs, viewing their death as a "heavenly birthday" and celebrating their anniversaries annually. These commemorations, held at burial sites like catacombs, included prayers, Eucharist, and shared stories of martyrs like Polycarp and Ignatius to inspire faith and courage. Shared meals reinforced fellowship and unity with Christ’s sacrifice. Tertullian called martyrs "the seed of the Church" (<em>Apologeticus</em> 50), and <em>The Martyrdom of Polycarp</em> (c. 156) highlights their enduring legacy. Biblical passages like Revelation 6:9–11 and Matthew 5:10–12 affirm their heavenly reward and encourage perseverance. Early Christians likely observed 20–25 annual martyr commemorations, honoring figures like Stephen, Peter, Paul, and others who exemplified faith through sacrifice.</p>

    <p>Pascha or Easter was the central celebration of Pre-Nicene Christianity, commemorating Jesus’ passion, death, and resurrection as the fulfillment of the Jewish Passover. All four Gospels affirm that Jesus' resurrection took place on the first day of the week, which is Sunday (Matthew 28:1-10, Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-12, John 20:1-18).</p>
    <p>The 1st and 2nd-century Christian consensus, as seen in Irenaeus (Against Heresies, Book 5) and Hippolytus (The Apostolic Tradition, c. 215 A.D.), holds that Easter (Pascha) is celebrated on the Sunday following the 14th of Nisan, the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox. Pope Anicetus of Rome supported this practice, aligning with the Roman tradition of observing Easter on Sunday rather than the 14th of Nisan (Irenaeus, Against Heresies, Book 3, Chapter 3).</p>
    <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
      <p>This date makes it distinct from the Jewish Passover (Pesach), which occurs on the 14th of Nisan. Polycarp of Smyrna and Melito of Sardis, both bishops in Asia Minor, advocated for celebrating Easter on the 14th of Nisan, aligning it with the Jewish Passover (Eusebius, <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> 5.24; Irenaeus, <em>Against Heresies</em> 3.3.4).</p>
    </div>
    <p>Pascha (Easter) emphasized Christ’s victory over sin and death, symbolizing the new creation and hope for Christians (Irenaeus, <em>Against Heresies</em>, Book 5).</p>
    <p>Christians prepared for this celebration through fasting and catechesis, typically lasting 1-2 days (Hippolytus, <em>The Apostolic Tradition</em>, c. 215 A.D.).</p>
    <p>The occasion was marked by nighttime vigils, scripture readings, prayers, and a sunrise Eucharist, all reflecting the triumph of the resurrection (Tertullian, <em>De Corona</em>, Chapter 3).</p>
    <p>The event also symbolized renewal and hope, as believers celebrated Christ’s resurrection as the foundation of new life (Irenaeus, <em>Against Heresies</em>, Book 5). Communal meals and hymns highlighted unity and joy within the Christian community (The Didache, Chapters 9-10).</p>

<p>Pentecost, celebrated fifty days after Pascha, marked the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as described in Acts 2, where the Spirit enabled them to speak in various languages, leading to the conversion of about 3,000 people (Acts 2:1–4, 41). This event signified the beginning of the Church’s mission to spread the gospel universally and was seen as the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy about God pouring out His Spirit on all people (Acts 2:16–21; Joel 2:28–32).</p>

<div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
  <p>Pentecost was observed as a day of worship and reflection, with Christians gathering for communal prayer, scripture readings, and breaking of bread (Acts 2:42). The Eucharist held a central place in these gatherings, symbolizing the unity of believers and their shared faith in Christ (Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 66; <em>Didache</em> 9–10).</p>
</div>

<div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
  <p>Preaching focused on the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering the Church and spreading the gospel (Acts 2:1–4, 16–21; 1 Corinthians 12:4–11).</p>

<p>The Book of Acts suggests that baptisms were integral to Pentecost celebrations, as the Spirit's outpouring was closely associated with repentance and baptism (Acts 2:38–41). Fellowship and communal sharing were also emphasized, as believers shared meals and resources, strengthening their unity and commitment to one another (Acts 2:44–46).</p>

        <p>The Lord's Day, observed every Sunday, commemorates Jesus' resurrection, as attested in Acts 20:7 and 1 Corinthians 16:2.</p>
      <p>Early Christians replaced the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) with Sunday, designating it the "first day of the week" and the "eighth day," symbolizing the new covenant and creation (Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Magnesians</em> 9; Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; <em>Epistle of Barnabas</em> 15:8–9).</p>
      <p>Weekly gatherings included scripture readings, prayers (e.g., the Lord's Prayer), hymns, and the Eucharist, where bread and wine were shared to remember Christ's sacrifice (Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; <em>Didache</em> 9–10; Acts 20:7; 1 Corinthians 11:23–26).</p>
      <p>Offerings were collected to support the poor, fostering communal unity, particularly during periods of persecution (Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; <em>Didache</em> 13). Due to Roman persecution, worship often took place in private homes, catacombs, or secret locations, as documented in Pliny’s <em>Epistles</em> (10.96), which describe Christians meeting before dawn to avoid detection. This practice became central to early Christian identity, blending spiritual devotion with communal solidarity (Acts 2:44–45; Tertullian, <em>Apologeticus</em> 39).</p>
