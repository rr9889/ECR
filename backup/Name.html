        <h1>Name</h1>
        <p>The early followers of Jesus, known as the First 
	Christians, adopted several titles reflecting their faith and dedication to 
		His teachings.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style6">Believers</h1>
		<p>Believers highlights faith as the core identity of Christ's 
		followers, emphasizing trust in Jesus and His teachings as the 
		foundation of their relationship with God (e.g., Acts 5:14, 2 
		Corinthians 6:15).</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style6">Brothers and Sisters</h1>
		<p>Brothers and Sisters reflects the familial bond among Christians, 
		emphasizing their shared identity as children of God and members of His 
		spiritual family (e.g., Romans 8:29, Hebrews 2:11). This term highlights 
		unity, love, and mutual support within the Christian community.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style6">Christian</h1>
		<p>The term &quot;Christian&quot; (<span lang="grc" title="Koin&#275; Greek-language text">&#935;&#961;&#8145;&#963;&#964;&#8144;&#8113;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>,
		<span title="Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language romanization">
		<i lang="grc-Latn">Khr&#299;sti&#257;nós)</i></span>, derived from the Greek 
		&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962; (<em>Christos</em>), meaning &quot;the Anointed One,&quot; was first used 
		in Acts 11:26 to describe followers of Christ. Likely coined by 
		outsiders in Antioch, it initially served as a label for those 
		associated with Jesus and His teachings. Over time, believers embraced 
		&quot;Christian&quot; as their identity, and it became the widely recognized name 
		for adherents of Christianity.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style7"><strong>Disciples</strong></h1>
		<p>Disciples, derived from the Greek &#956;&#945;&#952;&#951;&#964;&#942;&#962; (math&#275;t&#275;s) meaning 
		&quot;learner,&quot; were early followers of Jesus, committed to understanding His 
		teachings and emulating His life. Initially the Twelve Apostles, the 
		term grew to include all believers devoted to spreading the Gospel 
		through love, humility, and service. Discipleship required full 
		devotion, personal sacrifice, and a life of worship and ethical living, 
		forming the foundation of Christian identity before the Nicene era. 
		(e.g., Matthew 28:19, Acts 6:1).</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style6">Saints</h1>
		<p>&quot;Saints&quot; signifies those set apart as holy for God, sanctified 
		through faith in Christ (e.g., Romans 1:7, 1 Corinthians 1:2). In the 
		Old Testament, this identity stems from obedience and sacrificial 
		worship; in the New Testament, it includes all believers in Christ, 
		justified by faith and called to holiness. Saints live out their calling 
		through worship, prayer, and love.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style6">The Nazarenes</h1>
		<p>Another title was &quot;The Nazarenes,&quot; linked to Jesus of Nazareth, as 
		mentioned in Acts 24:5, where His followers were called &quot;the sect of the 
		Nazarenes.&quot; This name pointed to Jesus's origins in Nazareth and 
		fulfilled the prophecy of Him being &quot;called a Nazarene&quot; (Matthew 2:23). 
		It identified His followers with their leader and emphasized His 
		importance in their faith.</p>
		<h1 class="auto-style6">The Way</h1>
		<p>Refers to the distinct path of faith and practice centered on Jesus's 
		teachings and His role as the Messiah. &quot;The Way&quot; (&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#8001;&#948;&#959;&#8166;) is mentioned 
		in Acts 9:2, where Saul sought to arrest those who followed this 
		movement. The term emphasizes a transformative way of life and belief 
		rooted in Jesus's message and mission.</p>
