      <h1>Name</h1>
      <p>The early followers of Jesus, known as the First Christians, adopted
        several titles reflecting their faith and dedication to His teachings.</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style6">Believers</h1>
      <p>Believers highlights faith as the core identity of Christ's followers,
        emphasizing trust in Jesus and His teachings as the foundation of their
        relationship with God (e.g., Acts 5:14, 2 Corinthians 6:15). followers,
        emphasizing trust in Jesus and His teachings as the foundation of their
        relationship with God (e.g., Acts 5:14, 2 Corinthians 6:15).</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style6">Brothers and Sisters</h1>
      <p>Brothers and Sisters reflects the familial bond among Christians,
        emphasizing their shared identity as children of God and members of His
        spiritual family (e.g., Romans 8:29, Hebrews 2:11). emphasizing their
        shared identity as children of God and members of His spiritual family
        (e.g., Romans 8:29, Hebrews 2:11). This term highlights unity, love, and
        mutual support within the Christian community.</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style6">Christian</h1>
      <p>The term "Christian" (<span title="Koinē Greek-language text" lang="grc">Χρῑστῐᾱνός</span>,
        <span title="Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language romanization"> <i lang="grc-Latn">Khrīstiānós)</i></span>,
        derived from the Greek Χριστός (<em>Christos</em>), meaning "the
        Anointed One," was first used in Acts 11:26 to describe followers of
        Christ. Likely coined by outsiders in Antioch, it initially served as a
        label for those associated with Jesus and His teachings. Over time,
        believers embraced "Christian" as their identity, and it became the
        widely recognized name for adherents of Christianity.</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style7"><strong>Disciples</strong></h1>
      <p>Disciples, derived from the Greek μαθητής (mathētēs) meaning "learner,"
        were early followers of Jesus, committed to understanding His teachings
        and emulating His life. Initially the Twelve Apostles, the term grew to
        include all believers devoted to spreading the Gospel through love,
        humility, and service. Discipleship required full devotion, personal
        sacrifice, and a life of worship and ethical living (e.g., Matthew
        28:19, Acts 6:1).</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style6">Saints</h1>
      <p>"Saints" signifies those set apart as holy for God, sanctified through
        faith in Christ (e.g., Romans 1:7, 1 Corinthians 1:2). In the Old
        Testament, this identity stems from obedience and sacrificial worship;
        in the New Testament, it includes all believers in Christ, justified by
        faith and called to holiness. Saints live out their calling through
        worship, prayer, and love.</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style6">The Nazarenes</h1>
      <p>Another title was "The Nazarenes," linked to Jesus of Nazareth, as
        mentioned in Acts 24:5, where His followers were called "the sect of the
        Nazarenes." This name pointed to Jesus's origins in Nazareth and
        fulfilled the prophecy of Him being "called a Nazarene" (Matthew 2:23).
        It identified His followers with their leader and emphasized His
        importance in their faith.</p>
      <h1 class="auto-style6">The Way</h1>
      <p>Refers to the distinct path of faith and practice centered on Jesus's
        teachings and His role as the Messiah. "The Way" (τῆς ὁδοῦ) is mentioned
        in Acts 9:2, where Saul sought to arrest those who followed this
        movement. The term emphasizes a transformative way of life and belief
        rooted in Jesus's message and mission.</p>
