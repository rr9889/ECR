      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>Christianity in its earliest centuries (before A.D. 325) was marked
          by simplicity, deep spirituality, and a strong communal focus. Rooted
          in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, the early Church adapted
          Jewish traditions to reflect the new covenant, creating practices that
          were profound expressions of faith, unity, and hope, often carried out
          under persecution.</p>
        <p>This exploration draws from 1st and 2nd-century writings, including
          The Didache (c. 100 A.D.), Tertullian’s De Corona and Apologeticus (c.
          197 A.D.), Hippolytus’ Apostolic Tradition (c. 215 A.D.), Ignatius of
          Antioch’s Letter to the Smyrnaeans (c. 110 A.D.), Irenaeus’ Against
          Heresies (c. 180 A.D.), Pliny’s Epistles (c. 112 A.D.), The Martyrdom
          of Polycarp (c. 156 A.D.), and the New Testament. These sources reveal
          the spiritual life of early Christians, their celebrations, and their
          unwavering commitment to Christ.</p>
        <p>From the weekly Lord’s Day to the annual Pascha (Easter), and from
          communal Agape Feasts to the solemn commemorations of martyrs, early
          Christian practices were deeply rooted in Scripture. They fostered
          unity, spiritual growth, and witness to the world, laying the
          foundation for centuries of Christian worship and community life.</p>
        <p>This introduction highlights how early Christians lived out their
          faith in a hostile world, demonstrating the transformative power of
          the gospel through celebrations, fasting, teaching, and acts of
          charity.</p>

                <p>The Lord's Day, observed every Sunday, commemorates Jesus'
                  resurrection, as attested in Acts 20:7 and 1 Corinthians 16:2.</p>
                <!-- Image and Caption Container -->
                <p>Early Christians replaced the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday) with
                  Sunday, designating it the "first day of the week" and the
                  "eighth day," symbolizing the new covenant and creation
                  (Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Magnesians</em> 9;
                  Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; <em>Epistle of
                    Barnabas</em> 15:8–9).</p>
                <p>Weekly gatherings included scripture readings, prayers (e.g.,
                  the Lord's Prayer), hymns, and the Eucharist, where bread and
                  wine were shared to remember Christ's sacrifice (Justin
                  Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; <em>Didache</em> 9–10;
                  Acts 20:7; 1 Corinthians 11:23–26).</p>
                <p>Offerings were collected to support the poor, fostering
                  communal unity, particularly during periods of persecution
                  (Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; <em>Didache</em>
                  13). Due to Roman persecution, worship often took place in
                  private homes, catacombs, or secret locations, as documented
                  in Pliny’s <em>Epistles</em> (10.96), which describe
                  Christians meeting before dawn to avoid detection. This
                  practice became central to early Christian identity, blending
                  spiritual devotion with communal solidarity (Acts 2:44–45;
                  Tertullian, <em>Apologeticus</em> 39).</p>

              April 2025 and 5 April 2026</span></em></p>
        <p>Pascha or Easter was the central celebration of Pre-Nicene
          Christianity, commemorating Jesus’ passion, death, and resurrection as
          the fulfillment of the Jewish Passover. All four Gospels affirm that
          Jesus' resurrection took place on the first day of the week, which is
          Sunday (Matthew 28:1-10, Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-12, John 20:1-18).</p>
        <p>The 1st and 2nd-century Christian consensus, as seen in Irenaeus
          (Against Heresies, Book 5) and Hippolytus (The Apostolic Tradition, c.
          215 A.D.), holds that Easter (Pascha) is celebrated on the Sunday
          following the 14th of Nisan, the first Sunday after the full moon
          following the vernal equinox. Pope Anicetus of Rome supported this
          practice, aligning with the Roman tradition of observing Easter on
          Sunday rather than the 14th of Nisan (Irenaeus, Against Heresies, Book
          3, Chapter 3).</p>
        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
          <p>This date makes it distinct from the Jewish Passover (Pesach),
            which occurs on the 14th of Nisan. Polycarp of Smyrna and Melito of
            Sardis, both bishops in Asia Minor, advocated for celebrating Easter
            on the 14th of Nisan, aligning it with the Jewish Passover
            (Eusebius, <em>Ecclesiastical History</em> 5.24; Irenaeus, <em>
              Against Heresies</em> 3.3.4).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Pascha (Easter) emphasized Christ’s victory over sin and death,
          symbolizing the new creation and hope for Christians (Irenaeus, <em>
            Against Heresies</em>, Book 5). </p>
        <p>Christians prepared for this celebration through fasting and
          catechesis, typically lasting 1-2 days (Hippolytus, <em>The Apostolic
            Tradition</em>, c. 215 A.D.). </p>
        <p>The occasion was marked by nighttime vigils, scripture readings,
          prayers, and a sunrise Eucharist, all reflecting the triumph of the
          resurrection (Tertullian, <em>De Corona</em>, Chapter 3). </p>
        <p>The event also symbolized renewal and hope, as believers celebrated
          Christ’s resurrection as the foundation of new life (Irenaeus, <em>Against
            Heresies</em>, Book 5). Communal meals and hymns highlighted unity
          and joy within the Christian community (The Didache, Chapters 9-10).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="auto-style1">Pentecost</h1>
        <p><em><span class="auto-style3">1 June 2025 and 21 May 2026</span></em></p>
        <p>Pentecost, celebrated fifty days after Pascha, marked the descent of
          the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as described in Acts 2, where the
          Spirit enabled them to speak in various languages, leading to the
          conversion of about 3,000 people (Acts 2:1–4, 41). This event
          signified the beginning of the Church’s mission to spread the gospel
          universally and was seen as the fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy about
          God pouring out His Spirit on all people (Acts 2:16–21; Joel 2:28–32).</p>
        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
          <p>Pentecost was observed as a day of worship and reflection, with
            Christians gathering for communal prayer, scripture readings, and
            breaking of bread (Acts 2:42). The Eucharist held a central place in
            these gatherings, symbolizing the unity of believers and their
            shared faith in Christ (Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 66; <em>Didache</em>
            9–10).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
          <p>Preaching focused on the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering the
            Church and spreading the gospel (Acts 2:1–4, 16–21; 1 Corinthians
            12:4–11).</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Book of Acts suggests that baptisms were integral to Pentecost
          celebrations, as the Spirit's outpouring was closely associated with
          repentance and baptism (Acts 2:38–41). Fellowship and communal sharing
          were also emphasized, as believers shared meals and resources,
          strengthening their unity and commitment to one another (Acts
          2:44–46).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="auto-style1">Martyrs' Commemorations</h1>
        <p><em><span class="auto-style3">Earthly death date of the martyr</span></em></p>
        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
          <p>Early Christians honored martyrs, viewing their death as a
            "heavenly birthday" and celebrating their anniversaries annually.
            These commemorations, held at burial sites like catacombs, included
            prayers, Eucharist, and shared stories of martyrs like Polycarp and
            Ignatius to inspire faith and courage. Shared meals reinforced
            fellowship and unity with Christ’s sacrifice. Tertullian called
            martyrs "the seed of the Church" (<em>Apologeticus</em> 50), and <em>
              The Martyrdom of Polycarp</em> (c. 156) highlights their enduring
            legacy. Biblical passages like Revelation 6:9–11 and Matthew 5:10–12
            affirm their heavenly reward and encourage perseverance. Early
            Christians likely observed 20–25 annual martyr commemorations,
            honoring figures like Stephen, Peter, Paul, and others who
            exemplified faith through sacrifice.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="auto-style1">Agape Feasts</h1>
        <p><em><span class="auto-style3">No fixed date, a flexible practice, or
              tied to other Chrisitan events</span></em></p>
        <p>The Agape Feast was a communal meal regularly celebrated by all
          members of the Christian community, including the poor and
          marginalized, often in conjunction with the Eucharist. These
          gatherings took place in homes or meeting spaces, where participants
          shared food and resources, reflecting Jesus’ teachings on generosity
          and care for others. The meals emphasized unity, charity, and Christ’s
          love, ensuring the needs of all were met and reinforcing equality
          within the Church. While initially linked to the Eucharist, abuses
          like those mentioned in 1 Corinthians 11:20–22 led to their separation
          over time. Through acts of mutual care, the Agape Feast fostered a
          deep sense of community and charity among early Christians.</p>
        <p>The Agape Feasts are rooted in Jude 12, which directly references
          "love feasts" as communal meals among Christians. Acts 2:46 describes
          believers breaking bread in homes with joy and unity, while 1
          Corinthians 11:20–22 critiques their misuse, calling for equality in
          such gatherings.</p>
        <p>The Didache (Chapters 9–10) outlines shared meals connected to
          prayers and thanksgiving, and Tertullian (<em>Apology</em> 39)
          highlights them as acts of charity and fellowship for the poor. These
          sources establish the Agape Feasts as communal meals emphasizing
          unity, charity, and worship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="auto-style1">Baptism</h1>
        <p><em><span class="auto-style3">No fixed date, could be standalone
              event, or tied to other Christian events</span></em></p>
        <p>In the 1st and 2nd centuries, baptism was both a standalone event
          and, at times, part of a larger celebration, depending on the context.</p>
        <p>Biblically, in the New Testament, baptism is closely linked to
          immediate conversion and repentance, with new converts often baptized
          shortly after accepting the faith (Acts 2:38, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 9:18,
          Acts 16:30-33). Baptism is presented as a standalone event associated
          with repentance, forgiveness, and the receiving of the Holy Spirit
          (e.g., Acts 2:38, Acts 8:36-38).</p>
        <p>Early 1st-century Christian texts, such as the Didache, show that
          baptism often occurred alongside other rites like fasting and prayers
          but was also emphasized as a distinct event. Tertullian and Ignatius
          indicate that while baptism was a key act of Christian initiation, it
          was sometimes celebrated alongside the Eucharist but could also stand
          on its own (Tertullian, <em>De Baptismo</em>, Chapter 1; Ignatius of
          Antioch, <em>Letter to the Ephesians</em>, Chapter 20). Thus, while
          baptism was essential for Christian initiation, early Christian
          communities sometimes celebrated it in conjunction with other rites,
          such as the Eucharist, especially during larger gatherings or special
          occasions like Pentecost.</p>

        <h1 class="auto-style1"><span lang="en-ca">Fasting</span></h1>
        <p><em><span class="auto-style3">Wednesdays and Fridays</span></em></p>
        <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Fasting in preparation for major feasts like
          Easter (Pascha) is mentioned in early Christian writings, particularly
          the Didache (c. 100 A.D.). The Didache (Chapters 8-9) provides clear
          instructions on fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays, which were seen as
          days of penance and preparation for Christian worship and communion.
          They were part of the early Christian discipline of preparing
          spiritually for the celebration of the Eucharist. The Didache
          emphasizes that fasting should be done in a manner that sets
          Christians apart from the practices of the Pharisees and hypocrites,
          suggesting a more spiritual and humble approach to fasting. This
          practice of fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays was widespread in early
          Christianity, with many Christian communities (Rome, Alexandria, and
          Asia Minor, Syria, North Africa) adopting it as a regular form of
          penance, spiritual reflection, and preparation for worship" (Didache,
          Chapters 8-9; Tertullian, <em>De Corona</em>, Chapter 3; Clement of
          Alexandria, <em>Stromata</em>, Book 3, Chapter 2).</p>

        <p>In the Didache (c. 100 A.D.), "teaching" or "instruction" (didachē)
          refers to the moral guidance for new converts before baptism. In
          Hippolytus' Apostolic Tradition (c. 215 A.D.), the term "catechesis"
          (catechēseis) is used more formally for pre-baptismal instruction,
          focusing on Christian doctrine, confession, and ethical practices.</p>
        <p>Early Christian catechesis was closely tied to baptism, serving as
          the foundational preparation for new converts. The Didache (c. 100
          A.D.) provides basic instructions for baptizing new believers,
          including the essential elements of faith and moral conduct that
          candidates needed to demonstrate before baptism. It emphasizes the
          importance of teaching the commands of Jesus, and lays out a structure
          for pre-baptismal instruction, with particular focus on ethical living
          and adherence to Christian principles.</p>
        <p>The Apostolic Tradition by Hippolytus (c. 215 A.D.) offers a more
          formalized and detailed approach to catechetical instruction,
          especially in the context of Christian initiation through baptism.
          Hippolytus outlines a thorough process where candidates undergo
          significant preparation for baptism, including confession of faith,
          instruction on Christian living, and moral teachings. His work also
          emphasizes the laying on of hands after baptism, marking the receipt
          of the Holy Spirit, further solidifying the initiation process. This
          catechesis was critical to ensuring that converts were fully grounded
          in the Christian faith and ready to join the community of believers
          through baptism.</p>
        <p>Thus, in early Christianity, catechesis and baptism were inseparable,
          as baptism represented the culmination of one's spiritual preparation
          and entrance into the Christian community.</p>

          <p>Early Christians extended their faith beyond formal worship through
            teaching, fellowship, and charity, often gathering in house churches
            for scripture readings, prayer, and Eucharist (<em>Didache</em>
            9–10; Acts 2:42–47). </p>
          <p>Paul’s letters highlight house churches as centers for study,
            fellowship, and worship, where believers gathered for teaching,
            prayer, and communal meals (Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:19).</p>
          <p>Acts of charity, such as sharing resources and supporting the poor,
            were central to the communal life of early Christians. They sold
            possessions to meet the needs of others and collected funds to
            support those in need, reflecting their commitment to unity and
            generosity (Acts 2:44–45, 4:32–34; 1 Corinthians 16:1–2).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Early Christian texts, such as the Didache and the writings of
            Tertullian and Ignatius of Antioch, emphasize generosity and care
            for the vulnerable as essential expressions of Christian love and
            solidarity (<em>Didache</em> 1:5–6; Tertullian, <em>Apologeticus</em>
            39; Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Smyrnaeans</em> 8).</p>
