        <p style="text-align: justify;">Fasting was central to early Christian
          life as a discipline of repentance, spiritual preparation, and
          humility. This guide outlines its biblical and historical foundations,
          drawing on pre-325 AD sources and the writings of the Church Fathers.

      <b> Fasting for Spiritual Strength and Preparation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the wilderness before
          beginning His ministry and facing the devil's temptations. Fasting can
          strengthen you for spiritual challenges and prepare you to stand firm
          against temptation (Matthew 4:2, Luke 4:2).</li>
        <li>Jesus taught that prayer and fasting are sometimes required for
          overcoming significant spiritual obstacles. Fasting enhances your
          spiritual authority and connection with God during challenges (Matthew
          17:21, Mark 9:29)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Fasting as an Act of Longing for Christ and God<br>
        </b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jesus explained that His disciples would fast after His departure,
          signifying fasting as an act of longing and spiritual connection.
          Fasting expresses your deep desire for Christ’s presence and guidance
          in your life (Matthew 9:14-15, Mark 2:18-20, Luke 5:33-35).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The prophetess Anna fasted as part of her worship and devotion to
          God. Fasting can be a form of worship, dedicating yourself wholly to
          God in prayer and praise (Luke 2:37)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Fasting for Guidance and Decision-Making</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 1st Century churches fasted to seek God’s direction when
          commissioning leaders and appointing elders. Fasting helps you seek
          clarity and wisdom when faced with important decisions or
          responsibilities (Acts 13:2-3; Acts 14:23).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Fasting with the Right Heart</b><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jesus instructed His followers not to make a show of their fasting,
          but to do it humbly and privately. Fasting should be done for God, not
          for the approval or admiration of others (Matthew 6:16-18)</li>
        <li>Avoiding being Self-Righteous for the wrong reasons. The Pharisee’s
          boastful fasting serves as a warning against pride in spiritual
          disciplines (Luke 18:12).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Fasting as a Test of Perseverance</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Apostle Paul fasted as part of his dedication to the gospel,
          enduring both voluntary and involuntary deprivation. Fasting teaches
          endurance and reliance on God through physical and spiritual
          challenges (2 Cor 6:5; 2 Cor 11:27).</li>
      </ul>
