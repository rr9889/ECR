    <h4>Evidence 1</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> The First Epistle to the Corinthians, authored by Paul, is addressed
        to:
        <blockquote>"Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of
          God, and Sosthenes the brother, to the Assembly of God that is in
          Corinth, sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, <u><b>with all
              those calling on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
              place—both theirs and ours:</b></u> Grace to you and peace from
          God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" <strong>- 1 Corinthians
            1:1–3 LSV<br>
          </strong></blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Paul is addressing the universal Church, not just the local church
            in Corinth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> 1 Corinthians 1:16 concludes Paul's instructions on Christian head
        coverings:
        <blockquote> "But if anyone wants to argue about this, I simply say that
          we have no other custom than this, and neither do God's other
          churches." </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li> Biblical language scholar <a href="https://www.bible-researcher.com/biog.html">Michael
          Marlowe</a> cites 1 Corinthians 14:37:
        <blockquote> "If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by
          the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the
          Lord’s command." </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li> This demonstrates that Paul taught these traditions, including
            head covering, as commandments of the Lord. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Evidence 2</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://www.benw3.com/">Ben Witherington III </a>(1995)
      explains: </p>
    <blockquote> "Paul is not simply endorsing standard Roman or even
      Greco-Roman customs in Corinth. Paul was about the business of reforming
      his converts' social assumptions and conventions in the context of the
      Christian community. They were to model new Christian customs, common in
      the assemblies of God but uncommon in the culture, thus staking out their
      own sense of a unique identity." </blockquote>

    <h4>Evidence 3</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://www.cbeinternational.org/person/philip-b-payne/">Payne,
        Philip Barton </a>(2015) argues: </p>
    <blockquote> "If Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:5 were requiring a garment
      covering the head, he would have been advocating something that was not
      customary for Greek women, nor was it customary in the Pauline or Petrine
      churches. Furthermore, Greek women, including women in prayer, were
      usually depicted without a garment covering the head. It does not make
      sense that Paul would assert something was disgraceful that in their
      culture was not considered disgraceful." </blockquote>

        Sproul </a>highlights: </p>
    <blockquote> "The practice of head covering is a uniquely Christian command,
      especially because the reasons for the command are uniquely Christian.
      Rather than Paul appealing to First Century culture, God's direction for
      the use of head coverings was actually counter-cultural." </blockquote>

    <h4>Evidence 7</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span class="reference-text"><cite class="citation book cs1">Given
            these considerations, it may be best to understand “authority on her
            head” in verse 10 as referring to the authority of the man (or
            husband). This authority allows the woman to pray and prophesy in
            worship as long as it is evident that she is under the authority of
            man, symbolized by the head-covering. The use of exousia in this
            context, where one might otherwise expect a direct reference to the
            head-covering itself, underscores its symbolic role.This
            interpretation is further supported by the chiasmic structure of
            verses 7–10, which clarifies Paul’s argument. Verse 7 states that
            man is the image and glory of God, while woman is the glory of man.
            Verses 8 and 9 emphasize the creation order, with woman created from
            and for man. Finally, verse 10 concludes that a woman ought to have
            authority on her head because of the angels, tying together the
            theological and practical implications of head-coverings in
            worship.In conclusion, while alternative interpretations suggest
            that “authority on her head” refers to a woman’s active authority,
            the traditional understanding—that the head-covering symbolizes her
            submission to the authority of her husband—remains more consistent
            with the cultural and theological context of Paul’s teaching. This
            view aligns with the broader scriptural narrative and the early
            Church’s understanding of this passage.</cite></span> </p>

                  W. Shepherd</a>, in their <em>Commentary on 1st Corinthians</em>,
                explain the traditional interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11. They
                write:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>"Every man who covers his head while praying or prophesying
                  acknowledges dependence on an earthly head rather than Christ,
                  his heavenly head, dishonoring Him."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>They connect this to the Old Testament, where male priests wore
                turbans or caps. Since Jesus was not yet revealed, there was no
                command for men to pray with uncovered heads. The New Testament
                practice reflects the new covenant, where men pray uncovered to
                honor Christ directly. This highlights the shift from Old
                Testament symbolism to New Testament worship.</p>

          <p>Ezra Palmer Gould, a professor at the Episcopal Divinity School,
            observed that both long hair and the veil served as coverings for a
            woman’s head. He explained:</p>
          <blockquote>

                        <p>"Nature itself is therefore a divine confirmation of
                          the constitutional sense of the impropriety of women
                          appearing in the assembly without a head covering (v.
                          13). The words 'for her long hair is given to her as a
                          covering' (v. 15) do not mean that the woman's hair is
                          her covering and that she needs no veil—a view that
                          vitiates the force of 11:2–14. For example, if hair
                          were the only covering referred to in this passage
                          (11:1–16), then verse 6 would have to be translated,
                          'If a woman does not wear her hair, she should have to
                          have her hair cut or shaved off; she should wear her
                          hair,' which is quite ludicrous. Two coverings are
                          spoken of in the passage. This is established by the
                          fact that two different Greek words are used..."</p>

            <p>On the whole, modern interpreters largely agreed that the
              covering Paul required was a veil or material headdress until the
              mid-twentieth century. Although the view that the covering
              referred to long hair had been popular among various groups
              throughout the 20th century, Abel Isaakson was the first to
              present an extended scholarly argument for this position in print.
              His work, <em>Marriage and Ministry in the New Temple</em>
              (1965), offered five key arguments:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Contemporary Judaism had no prohibition against men covering
                  their heads during worship; in fact, priests were required to
                  wear headgear (e.g., Exodus 28:36–40; Ezekiel 44:18).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The Greek phrase ἀκατακαλύπτῳ τῇ κεφαλῇ corresponds to the
                  Hebrew phrase for "loose hair hanging down," as seen in the
                  Septuagint (e.g., Leviticus 13:45; Numbers 5:18).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The context of the passage focuses on hair, suggesting that
                  the implied object of ἔχων is τὴν κόμην ("long hair").</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Verse 14 specifically identifies long hair as degrading for
                  men.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Paul’s use of the term κεφαλή ("head") ties the discussion of
                  hair to his broader theological argument.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>More recently, a growing number of scholars have independently
              reached similar conclusions. In a recent article, <strong>Francis
                Watson</strong> notes that this interpretation is gaining "broad
              consensus in recent scholarship." This view can be further divided
              into two camps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Those who see Paul’s concern as primarily about <strong>hair
                    style</strong> for both men and women.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Those who focus on <strong>hair condition</strong>, arguing
                  that men must avoid long hair (as it is feminine) and women
                  must avoid loose hair, instead putting it up neatly.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite this shift, the traditional interpretation—that Paul is
              referring to a <strong>material head-covering</strong>—continues
              to have contemporary supporters.</p>

                  <p>The practice of women wearing head coverings during public
                    worship is deeply rooted in the Word of God and supported by
                    Paul’s theological arguments. Individuals and churches must
                    prayerfully consider this issue and answer for themselves
                    before the Lord, without imposing it as a term of communion
                    with others.Paul’s exhortation in 1 Corinthians 11 addresses
                    the role of women in worship, emphasizing the theological
                    significance of head coverings. He grounds his argument in
                    creation, stating in verse 10, "For this cause (that is, the
                    woman being created for the man)..." This highlights the
                    divine order and the symbolic importance of head coverings
                    as a reflection of God’s authority structure.Recent
                    discussions have rediscovered the relevance of this
                    practice, noting that Paul’s use of theological arguments
                    makes it clear that godly women wearing head coverings in
                    public worship is a divine requirement. This practice
                    visibly reinforces God’s created order and serves as a
                    testament to the integrity of Scripture and Paul’s
                    teachings.In defending the head-covering issue, it is
                    essential to uphold:The integrity of God’s Word;The
                    integrity of Paul’s writings;A component of public worship
                    that visibly affirms God’s authority and created order.While
                    the practice may not be universally enforced as a term of
                    fellowship, its theological and symbolic significance
                    remains a vital part of biblical worship.</p>

                  <p>"The argument is often made that a woman’s hair is

                    15: <em>'her hair is given to her for a covering.'</em>
                    However, we must not assume that this single sentence
                    negates everything Paul has clearly established in the
                    preceding verses. The Greek word for 'covering' in verse 15
                    is peribolaion, which differs from katakalupto, the term
                    used earlier to describe the veiling. This distinction
                    indicates that while hair serves as a type of covering, the
                    veiling mentioned in the previous verses is intended to
                    fully cover the head and hair."</p>

                  <p>I offer this survey of ancient headcovering practices in
                    the hope that it will clear away some common misconceptions,
                    and bring into sharper focus the customs which many biblical
                    expositors have held to be so important for an understanding
                    of the Apostle Paul's instruction to the Corinthians
                    regarding headcoverings. Too often I find that the
                    statements made by biblical expositors on this subject are
                    inaccurate and simplistic. The more research I have done on
                    the subject, the more I have come to see how problematic is
                    the widely-accepted interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2-16
                    which asserts that Paul is merely urging the saints in
                    Corinth to conform to local and secular customs. In my
                    opinion this idea raises more problems than it solves.</p>
                  <p>I conclude that Paul's explanations pertain to an
                    established Christian custom, which may or may not have
                    corresponded to any Jewish, Greek, or Roman custom of the
                    time. Most "cultural background" treatments of this subject
                    have failed to recognize the importance of the fact that in
                    the first century the Church was itself a sub-culture,
                    having its own traditions and customs.</p>

                    Ages, the Reformation, and into the 19th century, when
                    bonnets and hats became more fashionable than spiritual. By
                    the 20th century, the tradition of head coverings in Western

                <blockquote>Naselli explains that head coverings in 1
                  Corinthians 11:2–16 were a deliberate practice reflecting
                  Christian theological principles, distinct from Greco-Roman
                  customs. For example, Roman priests, often men of high social
                  status, pulled their togas over their heads during pagan
                  ceremonies, a practice Paul instructed Christian men to avoid
                  to maintain their distinct identity. Similarly, a woman’s head
                  covering, such as a thin scarf, symbolized modesty, chastity,
                  and submission to her husband, marking her as married in the
                  Greco-Roman context. At the time, some rebellious wives in
                  Roman society rejected this symbol, often indicating sexual
                  promiscuity by removing their veils, further underscoring the
                  countercultural nature of Paul’s teaching. Paul also
                  emphasized the universal principle behind these practices: men
                  and women should visibly reflect God’s design for gender
                  distinctions and marital roles in culturally appropriate ways.
                  Additionally, head coverings served as a testimony to angels,
                  highlighting the spiritual significance of maintaining order
                  and submission during worship. Despite emphasizing distinct
                  roles, Paul noted the interdependence of men and women (1 Cor.
                  11:11–12), affirming that God’s design for gender
                  relationships is both good and complementary. </blockquote>

                  slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters,
                  both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the
                  authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual
                  help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for
                  women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public
                  worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The
                  Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these
                  are not against the great principles of truth and holiness;
                  affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing
                  in the Bible.</blockquote>

                  <p>On the other hand, for a woman to have her head uncovered
                    in divine service is to dishonor her head, it being all one
                    as if her head was shaved (1 Corinthians 11:5). Therefore,
                    it is concluded that if it is a shame for her to be shaved
                    or shorn, she ought to be covered when attending the worship
                    of God (1 Corinthians 11:6). The reason why a man should be
                    uncovered at such a time is because he is the image and
                    glory of God; and the reason why the woman should be covered
                    is because she is the glory of the man, made for his glory,
                    and to be in subjection to him, of which the covering is a
                    token (1 Corinthians 11:7). That she is so is argued from
                    the order of creation, man being not of the woman, but the
                    woman of the man (1 Corinthians 11:8), and from the end of
                    creation, man being not for the woman, but the woman for the
                    man (1 Corinthians 11:9). Another reason why the woman
                    should be covered at the time of public worship is because
                    of the angels then present (1 Corinthians 11:10).</p>

                    seriously. As Terry comments, this final section emphasizes

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">As I said, my experience has
                    been that the "background history" given by commentators is
                    nearly always made up. After all, how can someone living
                    nearly two thousand years later in a different part of the
                    world possibly know what was going on in the first-century
                    Corinthian church? The passage in 1 Corinthians 11 tells us
                    nothing whatsoever about why Paul had to remind the
                    Corinthians of the church-wide practice. I think we can
                    reasonably infer that either men were praying with covered
                    heads, or women were praying with uncovered heads or both.
                    But that's the most the passage itself reveals. The
                    commentators give the impression that they have access to
                    some additional Christian writings from the time of Paul
                    that reveal what really was going on. But no such writings
                    exist. There is nothing. Nada! The only helpful Christian
                    writings we have are those of the early church, written
                    after the deaths is the apostles. What we learn from their
                    writings is that the New Testament commandment on the head
                    covering was practiced throughout the entire Christian
                    world, in all countries and cultures.</p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p>"Paul's directive is not motivated by 'the desire to
                    appease cultural norms' but is based on 'distinctions in the
                    creation record of Genesis 2, referring both to the order
                    and to the purpose of God's creation of man as male and
                    female (compare 1 Cor. 11:7-9 with Gen. 2:21-24).'"</p>
                  <p>"The point, then, is that the ultimate guide for Christians
                    is not culture (or its negation) but nature (physis)—and
                    nature, not as interpreted by culture, but as revealed in
                    Scripture."</p>
                  <p>"Christians are to 'do gender' (particularly, but not only,
                    in public worship) in a way that signals their grateful
                    recognition of both God-given sex differences and the
                    particularity of their own biologically determined sex."</p>
                  <p>"Most pointedly, Paul's teaching has implications for those
                    who are tempted to engage in a range of 'transgender
                    expressions'—attempts to flout gender norms, blur gender
                    distinctions, or transgress gender boundaries, often in the
                    name of 'culture-making.' On this score, Branson Parler's
                    reflection is helpful: 'Our culture-making with respect to
                    gender should not erase the proper creational diversity and
                    difference given in creation nor should it erase the
                    givenness of who we are. Rather, our culture-making is
                    always a response to the gift of who we are as male and
                    female, not something we invent ex nihilo.'"</p>
                  <p>"As O'Donovan gently reminds, growing in maturity involves
                    not only recognizing our body as a divine gift, but
                    'accepting this gift and learning to love it, even though we
                    may have to acknowledge that it does not come to us without
                    problems.'"</p>
                  <p>"In sum, for all its complexity, 1 Corinthians 11:2-16
                    constitutes a clear summons to contemporary Christian men
                    and women 'to embrace the gender sovereignly determined by
                    God at conception and revealed through anatomy, to
                    understand its distinct vertical and horizontal
                    responsibilities, and to live it out for one's entire
                    life.'"</p>

                <blockquote>11:16 Paul concludes this part of his argument with
                  a warning against dissension: If<br>
                  anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other
                  practice - nor do the<br>
                  churches of God. Paul's practice (or "custom" - it is the same
                  word used by Chrysostom<br>
                  in commenting on the meaning of "the nature of things" in v.
                  14) is not only his, but it is<br>
                  the only practice known among the churches of God. This is
                  Paul's final argument at the<br>
                  end of an extended discussion of the subject. That extended
                  discussion employed several<br>
                  different kinds of arguments to the effect that men and women
                  should continue to attire<br>
                  themselves differently in keeping with the established
                  practice of the churches and the<br>
                  warrants found in the narratives regarding the creation of the
                  first man and woman.<br>
                  Some have suggested that Paul means to say that he does not
                  want to be contentious<br>
                  so that if the readers decide they disagree with him that will
                  ultimately be acceptable to<br>
                  Paul. This is a serious misreading of Paul's argument and its
                  conclusion. Paul's point is that<br>
                  our behaviors are not merely a matter of personal preference
                  (as is often thought in the<br>
                  modern [or postmodern] Western world) but are lived out in a
                  community context, and so<br>
                  the well-being of the community (and of the other) must play
                  an integral role in our<br>
                  decisions regarding the attitudes and postures we assume with
                  respect to those around us.<br>
                  Paul began this passage by commending the Corinthians for
                  continuing to hold to the<br>
                  traditions he had passed on to them. As he comes to its
                  conclusion, he reminds them that<br>
                  what he has been defending are the traditions practiced by all
                  the churches of God. If his<br>
                  commendation of them is to stand, those who are uncomfortable
                  about the universal<br>
                  practice of the church will need to learn how to deal with the
                  conflict between their own<br>
                  perspectives and those who support the traditional practice of
                  the churches without<br>
                  becoming contentious.</blockquote>

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 27</span></h4>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>Paul's argument for veiling is rooted in the theological foundation
          of creation. Men should not wear a veil because they are the "image
          and glory of God," while women, as the "glory of man," are required to
          wear a veil as a sign of authority and respect for the divine order
          (Pages 231, 230). The necessity of veiling is signified by the word
          "ought" (opheilei), emphasizing its obligatory nature. Paul ties this
          practice to cultural norms, suggesting that married women typically
          wore veils in public, while unmarried women might not have been bound
          by the same custom (Page 225). The reference to "angels" in 11:10 adds
          a spiritual dimension, implying that the practice transcends cultural
          context and aligns with divine order.</p>
        <p>However, challenges to veiling arise from interpretations of specific
          phrases. For instance, the word "authority" in verse 10 has been
          linked to the wearing of a veil, though some suggest it reflects a
          broader sense of a woman's role and dignity. Additionally, the use of
          the preposition "anti" in 11:15 has been debated, with some arguing
          that it suggests a woman's long hair could suffice as a covering
          instead of a veil, potentially undermining the need for an additional
          covering (Pages 234, 237). This interpretation, however, is contested,
          as it contradicts earlier assertions in the passage that emphasize a
          physical covering (Page 237).</p>
        <p>Further, Paul clarifies that his argument does not imply the
          superiority of men over women. He seeks to avoid any misunderstanding
          that could arise from references to women being created from and for
          men. Instead, he emphasizes mutual dependence in the Lord, qualifying
          the hierarchical implications of his earlier statements (Page 235).</p>

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 28</span></h4>
        <p><strong>Cultural and Archaeological Evidence</strong><br>
          The practice of veiling (e.g., veil, snood, cloak, or shawl) is
          supported by literary evidence and Greco-Roman statues, reliefs, and
          other archaeological artifacts, showing its widespread acceptance in
          historical contexts. (Page 189)<strong><br>
          </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Natural Symbolism</strong></p>
        <p>Leon Morris emphasizes that a woman's longer hair symbolizes the
          natural need for her head to be covered, aligning with nature's
          design. (Page 200)<strong><br>
          </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Historical Translation Consistency</strong><br>
          Early English translations, like the Revised Version (1881), reflected
          the interpretation that men should have "something on the head" and
          women should not be "bareheaded," supporting traditional covering
          practices. (Page 188)</p>
        <strong>Religious and Social Dishonor</strong>
        <p>Christian men who are covered dishonor themselves and Christ, their
          "head," while Christian women who do not coiffure or cover their hair
          bring shame, reinforcing the importance of veiling. (Page 184)<strong><br>

        <p><strong>Missionary and Cultural Context</strong><br>
          Paul ties veiling to the missionary witness to nonbelievers and the
          cultural expectations of a shame-honor society, suggesting its
          significance extends beyond personal piety to communal witness. (Page

          </span></h4>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Order and Headship in the Church</strong>: "Paul develops
            the whole subject of the woman's role in the local church. Two
            subjects are discussed—headship (11:3-12) and hair (11:13-16). The
            headship of the man is made immediately and abundantly clear."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>God’s Ordained Order</strong>: "God is a God of order...
            This order extends into human affairs, to government, to the home,
            to the church. In terms of human life the woman has a head, the man;
            the man has a head, Christ."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Equality and Responsibility</strong>: "This does not imply
            male superiority, nor does it imply female inferiority... This is
            God's ordained order and state of affairs."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Display of Headship</strong>: "When a man takes a leading
            role in a church activity, such as praying or preaching, he is to
            leave his physical head uncovered in order to display his headship
            in spiritual things and to acknowledge the headship of Christ."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>The Woman’s Role</strong>: "By contrast, the woman must
            display her subordination in the church: 'But every woman that
            prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her
            head.'"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Public Role of Women</strong>: "If and when a woman takes a
            public part in church worship, she must cover her physical head in
            order to honor the man who is her spiritual head."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Teaching Role of Women</strong>: "Women did have a teaching
            role in the church, but it had certain somewhat rigid restraints...
            related not only to God's order in creation but also to the woman's
            leading role in the Fall."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Symbol of Submission</strong>: "For a woman to pray or
            prophesy with her head uncovered means that she dishonors her head
            (the man), and that is the same, in God's sight, as though she were
            'shaven.'"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Cultural Distinction</strong>: "The reference is not to
            some token, such as a doily, but to a veil, a proper covering."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Significance of Angels</strong>: "The angels... look to see
            God's order reestablished and reaffirmed in the church—and God's
            order calls for the woman to cover her head when she prays or
            prophesies."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Mutual Dependence</strong>: "'Neither is the man without
            the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.'"</p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Paul’s Warning Against Contention</strong>: "Paul, it
            seemed, realized that this teaching would be unpopular... 'We have

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 31<br>
          </span></h4>
        <p>The discussion of veiling in <strong>1 Corinthians 11</strong>
          highlights several key theological and practical elements, reflecting
          its spiritual significance and broader implications for divine order
          and communal worship. Paul introduces <strong>"a tradition, new to
            the Corinthians, on the status of the gifted wives vis-à-vis their
            husbands and their attire in prayer and prophecy sessions of the
            pneumatics"</strong> (11:3-5a). This is not a mere cultural custom
          but rather an affirmation that <strong>"this church regulation was
            common to 'the churches of God'"</strong> (11:16; cf. 14:33),
          aligning with the practices of the four <strong>"allied apostolic
            missions of James, John, Paul, and Peter"</strong> (cf. Ellis, <em>Making</em>,
          60-69, 310-314).</p>
        <p>At the heart of Paul’s argument is the term <strong>κεφαλή ('head')</strong>,
          which he uses in the sentence: <strong>"The head of every man (άνήρ)
            is Christ; the head of the wife is her husband, and the head of
            Christ is God"</strong> (11:3). This has evoked disputes over
          whether <strong>'head' signifies 'source,' 'ruler'/'leader,' or
            'preeminence.'</strong> However, the consensus aligns it with <strong>"supremacy
            or preeminence in regard of divinely appointed order and authority"</strong>
          (cf. Eph. 5:23; Gen. 2:22-23; 3:16). Importantly, this hierarchical
          structure does not negate the parity of men and women but emphasizes
          that <strong>"in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor is
            man independent of woman"</strong> (11:11). The veil becomes <strong>"a
            sign of power ... not exercised but submitted to"</strong> (Godet
          II, 122), symbolizing both dignity and acknowledgment of divine order.</p>
        <p>Paul’s reference to <strong>"because of the angels"</strong> (11:10)
          further grounds the practice in theological reasoning. Angels have
          been interpreted variously as <strong>"ministering spirits"</strong>
          energizing spiritual gifts, <strong>"good angels present in Christian
            assemblies,"</strong> or witnesses to the order of worship. The
          directive in 11:10 <strong>"is drawing a conclusion from the
            preceding verses,"</strong> linking the wife’s role as <strong>"the
            glory of her husband"</strong> to the need for <strong>"a sign of
            authority ... manifested on her head."</strong></p>
        <p>Finally, Paul insists that this practice is not a Corinthian-specific
          rule but one observed universally: <strong>"We have no other custom,
            nor do the churches of God"</strong> (11:16). Rooted in <strong>creation
            theology</strong> and reflecting the <strong>Genesis creation
            narrative</strong>, the veil transcends cultural specificity and
          serves as <strong>"a visible marker of divine order"</strong> in
          worship. Thus, the directive encapsulates a timeless principle:
          honoring God’s design while maintaining modesty, authority, and
          reverence in the sacred assembly.</p>

      <div class="rt-scroll">"The Greek word rendered in the NIV 'a sign of
        authority' is <em>exousia</em>, which literally means 'power.' The
        Pulpit Commentary states about this, 'The very brief comment of Luther
        sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the
        subject. He says that <em>exousia</em> means ‘the veil or covering, by
        which one may see that she is under her husband’s authority.’'"</div>

        never been satisfactorily explained by any commentator. The Pulpit
        Commentary observes... 'On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be,
        out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always
        invisibly present in the Christian assemblies.'"</div>

      <div class="rt-scroll">"The relationship of a man to Christ is as Christ’s

        "The latest research into Roman clothing practices suggests that married
        women normally wore a head covering in public. Winter notes that “it was
        the social indicator by which the marital status of a woman was made
        clear to everyone.” 63 Sebesta argues that the head covering “symbolized
        the husband’s authority over his wife.”64 Most likely, then, Paul has
        reference to some women who were not wearing an external head covering.
        Now, unless one believes that the custom should be applied to our
        culture, it is not all that important to identify the exact form of
        covering. The main point is that the woman’s action is considered
        shameful, and for that reason Paul is willing to offer a theological
        reason for maintaining the custom of head coverings" (p.11)</div>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grudem challenged the interpretations of scholars
          like Bedale, the Mickelsens, and Bilezikian, as well as the LSJ
          lexicon, arguing that there is no clear evidence in non-biblical Greek
          (including the LXX) where kephale means "source." He allowed for the
          possibility in two cases but argued that another sense (e.g.,
          "authority over") fits better. Grudem argued that kephale meaning
          "authority over" was a well-established and recognizable meaning
          during the New Testament period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
          criticized the LSJ lexicon for not including this meaning, while
          praising BAGD for correctly including the LXX usage of kephale as
          "authority over." Grudem used the TLG database to analyze 12,000
          instances of kephale in Greek literature, narrowing it down to 2,000
          and identifying 323 additional word
          uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From these, he found 49
          metaphorical uses (including the LXX and New Testament) where he
          argued that kephale means "authority over" as the best senseGrudem
          contended that all New Testament references to kephale are best
          explained by the meaning "authority over," not "source." He extended
          this meaning to include related concepts like "leadership,"
          "guidance," and "direction."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grudem focused on
          non-biblical Greek evidence and sought to explain kephale in its
          specific contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He acknowledged that
          the Mickelsens recognized "authority over" as a possible sense of
          kephale, though they considered it rare.Grudem did not clearly define
          what he meant by the English word "source," which left room for
          criticism and further debate.</p>

        <p>On Head Coverings and Worship&nbsp; The authors acknowledge that
          Paul's instruction in 1 Corinthians 11 is not about restricting
          women's public roles in worship but rather about maintaining decorum
          to prevent scandal. They argue:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men and
          women equally engaged in leading worship in the Corinthian church, and
          Paul was not prohibiting their participation, only insisting that
          worship practices avoid public disgrace​&nbsp; . The passage does not
          suggest a hierarchy between men and women. Instead, it emphasizes
          interdependence, where men and women rely on each other, with God as
          their ultimate source​ . The phrase in verse 10, often interpreted as
          requiring women to wear a sign of submission, actually refers to a
          woman’s own authority over her head, rather than male authority over
          her​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; While some scholars argue
          that the word kephalē (head) implies male authority over women, the
          authors contend that Paul’s use of kephalē is unique and does not
          necessarily follow hierarchical interpretations from later theological
          developments​&nbsp; . Headship and Authority&nbsp; The concept of male
          headship in marriage and the church is a central point of contention.
          The authors challenge traditional readings that equate kephalē with
          male leadership:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In biblical Greek,
          kephalē does not consistently mean "leader" or "authority" but can
          also mean "source" or "preeminence"​&nbsp; . Paul’s analogy of Christ
          as the head of the church in Ephesians 5 emphasizes nourishment and
          unity, rather than hierarchical dominance​ . Hierarchical
          interpretations often rely on later developments in Christian thought
          rather than Paul’s actual usage of the
          term​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; Biblical and Theological
          Implications&nbsp; The authors argue that opposition to women's
          ordination has historically been based on cultural and theological
          assumptions rather than clear biblical
          mandates:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early church fathers opposed
          women’s leadership based on perceptions of their intellectual and
          moral inferiority rather than explicit scriptural prohibitions​&nbsp;
          . Protestant opposition has traditionally focused on male authority in
          preaching and teaching, while Catholic opposition has centered on the
          priesthood’s sacramental role, particularly the argument that a priest
          must be male to represent Christ​ . Both Protestant and Catholic
          arguments, however, are modern innovations that reinterpret scripture
          and tradition to fit theological concerns rather than faithfully
          preserving historical teachings</p>
        <p>"Even if by ‘head’ Paul means ‘more prominent/preeminent partner’ or
          (less likely) ‘one through whom the other exists’, his language and
          the flow of the argument seem to reflect an assumed hierarchy through
          which glory and shame flow upward from those with lower status to
          those above them. In this context the word almost certainly refers to
          one with authority over the other."</p>

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 37</span></h4>
        Paul uses <strong>nature (φύσις)</strong> to argue that men and women
        are created distinctly, with visible differences like hair length
        signifying God’s intentional design.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Long hair for women and short hair for men serve as
        natural markers of gender distinction, reflecting obedience to God’s
        creation order.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Women glorify God by fulfilling their God-given
        roles, symbolized by outward signs like long hair or veils, which
        indicate submission to divine intent.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Paul’s concern includes preventing behaviors or
        appearances (e.g., cutting hair or removing veils) that might blur
        gender distinctions or suggest rebellion against God’s order.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Barrett draws comparisons to <strong>Epictetus</strong>,
        who emphasizes the importance of preserving natural signs of gender
        distinction as a way of honoring divine order.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">Paul’s reasoning addresses cultural concerns about
        propriety and potentially counters behaviors associated with <strong>homosexuality
          or androgyny</strong>, which were viewed as blurring gender roles.</div>

      <div class="rt-scroll">"Paul is not saying that long hair replaces a veil.
        52 On the contrary, veiling is a reflection or extension of long hair. A
        woman’s hair is to be in a natural state, not curled or braided. And it
        is to be covered with a veil.53 Th e veil thus follows the contour of a
        woman’s long hair and accentuates the glory (δόξα) of her natural beauty
        without creating the social stigma of either immodesty or
        ostentatiousness. The emphasis upon her dress is not one of glamor but
        one of simplicity.” (p. 72).<br>
        <br>
        The <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong> ("covering") is described as an <strong>analog</strong>
        of a woman’s long hair, meaning the two serve related but distinct
        purposes. The veil <strong>reflects or complements</strong> the natural
        beauty and modesty represented by long hair, rather than replacing it
        outright. This interpretation rebuts the "long hair thesis," which
        claims Paul argues that a woman's long hair <strong>replaces the need
          for an artificial covering</strong>. Instead, the passage asserts that
        Paul maintains the necessity of veiling as a <strong>symbol of
          propriety</strong>. Jerome Murphy-O’Connor suggested that περιβόλαιον
        refers to hair wrapped around the head, interpreting Paul’s statement as
        advocating only for long hair, without requiring a veil. This reading is
        explicitly criticized as a misinterpretation because: The Greek
        preposition ἀντί ("as") is interpreted here to indicate correlation or
        complementarity, not substitution. The passage rejects the idea that
        long hair alone fulfills the symbolic requirements Paul outlines.
        Instead, it emphasizes that: Men: Short hair and no veil. Women: Long
        hair and a veil, both serving distinct but interconnected purposes in
        reflecting gender roles and maintaining modesty. Martin controversially
        interprets περιβόλαιον as referring metaphorically to "testicles,"
        suggesting that Paul’s argument contrasts women’s long hair (as their
        natural "covering") with men’s testicles, viewed as their corresponding
        natural marker of masculinity. This theory relies on ancient
        physiological conceptions and is unconventional. The passage rejects
        this interpretation, emphasizing that περιβόλαιον simply means "a head
        covering." (p. 72).<br>
        <br>
        “ Not only is Corinth sur-rounded by other cities where veiling is
        documented, 30 but Pausanias indi-cates that in whole cloth fashion all
        the Greeks share common cultural29) Strabo (11.13.9-10) records the view
        of ‘some’ (τινές) who say that Medea introducedinto Greek culture the
        wearing of a veil even over the face (καὶ ἐπικρυπτομένην τὴνὄψιν).30)

        these customs can be traced back to Homer.31 Th is, it must beadded,
        should not come as a surprise as Homer was the literary instrumentfor
        transmitting Greek culture from one generation to the next.” (pp.
        63-64).<br>

                        <li>Paul discusses women covering their heads while
                          praying or prophesying, then states that a woman’s

                        <li>Martin argues that the Greek word <strong>περιβόλαιον</strong>
                          in 1 Corinthians 11:15 should be translated as
                          “testicle.”</li>
                        <li>He posits that Paul is contrasting women’s hair with
                          male testicles based on ancient physiological beliefs

                        <li>Martin suggests that in antiquity, women’s hair was
                          considered part of their reproductive system, aiding
                          in drawing and retaining semen.</li>
                        <li>This interpretation would make Paul’s argument about

                          a body part.</li>
                        <li>Martin’s interpretation of the term as “testicles”

                        <li>Goodacre notes that a metaphorical interpretation
                          cannot justify redefining the word in 1 Corinthians

                          as “testicle” is unconvincing due to insufficient

        <h4>Evidence<span style="color: #222222;"> 41</span></h4>
        Wm. O. Walker, Jr. proposed an intriguing hypothesis to address the
        well-known challenges of interpreting <strong>1 Corinthians 11:2–16.</strong>
        He suggested three key points: (a) the entire section is an
        interpolation, (b) it is composed of three originally independent texts,
        and (c) none of these texts were authored by Paul. While this bold
        approach might initially appeal to those familiar with the complexities
        of this passage, a closer analysis reveals that the supporting arguments
        are highly problematic, both factually and methodologically.</div>

              We examined prayerfully the scriptural grounds of Christian
              attire, and found that Jesus and the apostles taught modesty and
              simplicity of life and modesty in dress and manners. The
              scriptures bearing on the subject of dress and adornment are of
              several classes: First. Jesus condemned anxious thought for
              raiment (Matt. 6: 25-33; Luke 12:22-31). Second. The direct
              teachings, such as 1 Tim. 2:9, 10; 1 Peter 3:3-5. Third. Teachings
              on nonconformity to the world in general, and that apply to dress
              on general principles, such as Romans 12:1, 2; 1 Cor. 10:31; 1
              Peter 1:14-15; 1 John 2:15-17. II. Investigation shows that the
              early church fathers and our own church fathers taught strongly
              and uniformly against pride and superfluity in dress, and
              constantly in favor of gospel plainness.</q></cite></span></div>

                <div class="volume-info-subtitle">As for the 20th and 21st
                  centuries, there have been a handful of faithful men and women
                  who have held the line on this vital biblical doctrine. The
                  late Dr. R. C. Sproul (1939-2017) taught the practice of
                  headcoverings in several sermons and teachings but defended
                  the practice and his interpretation in his book Knowing
                  Scripture. In his book Essential Truths of the Christian
                  Faith,he records, "During my high school years when I went to
                  church on Sunday morning, I never saw a woman in that church
                  whose head wasn't covered with a hat or a veil. That is one of
                  those customs that has simply disappeared for the most part
                  from Christian culture."41 In a sermon, he defends his reason
                  for upholding the practice of headcoverings by saying, "If
                  anything transcends local customs, it is those things that are
                  rooted and ordered in creation. That's why I'm very frightened
                  to be loose with this passage."42</div>

                <div class="volume-info-subtitle">In a feminist article titled
                  When Going Out Without a Hat was Grounds for Scandal, the
                  author writes, "For a growing numberof Western women,
                  beginning in the 1920s and continuing upuntil the 1960s, a hat
                  or headcovering felt like a symbol ofcontrol and regulation-a
                  symbol of the rules created by mengoverning the bodies of
                  women."46 Namely, the headcoveringand its religious roots
                  became the enemy of liberation.In 1927, a group of Spanish
                  feminists rebelling against theinfluences of the Catholic
                  Church in Spain formed a group called"Las Sinsombrero," which
                  means "those without hats."47 As agroup, they became popular
                  for their public refusal to conformto the gender norms of that
                  era. This was, of course, an effortto further dismantle the
                  symbols of religious life and biblical. gender identity in the
                  public square. Elizabeth Farians, who identifies as a Catholic
                  but is known for her feminist activism against religious
                  groups, formed a NOW task force in 1968 and called for a
                  "National Unveiling" to protest the tradition of requiring
                  women to cover their heads in church. The "Easter Bonnet
                  Rebellion" took place on Easter Sunday at a Milwaukee church
                  after a priest criticized a woman for her uncovered head.
                  Fifteen women with outrageously large hats approached the
                  communion rail, removed their hats, and received communion in
                  what she claims is the "first church demonstration for women's
                  rights."48 This rebellion and unveiling of women continued
                  from the 1960s through the 1980s. Despite the fact that a
                  headcovering is supposed to cover the head, the hats during
                  this period progres- sively became smaller until they
                  eventually disappeared. Luma Simms, in an article from 2013 on
                  Christianity Today titled "Uncovering the Head Covering
                  Debate,"wrote,"The practice of head covering continued even up
                  to the early 20th century ... By the 1960s in the West, the
                  biblical practice had become merely a tradition, so when hats
                  fell out of style, the practice was dropped in Christian
                  churches."49 The eradication of gender distinctions resulted
                  in increased feminine independence, causing a decline in the
                  number of women.starting families and a rise in female
                  participation in the work-force. As a consequence, chivalry,
                  defined as "an honorable andcourteous way of behavior,
                  particularly towards women," beganto disappear. Women, who had
                  previously found clear identityand purpose in marriage,
                  motherhood, and homemaking, werenow single, pursuing careers,
                  and lacking a framework for biblicalroles and femininity.I
                  want you to see that for nearly twenty centuries, the
                  churchinfluenced the culture on gender roles and modesty with
                  thispractice. It's fairly uncommon to see an ancient,
                  medieval, orhistorical painting or statue where a woman is not
                  wearing aheadcovering. Today, the tables have turned. Now, the
                  culture hasinfluenced the church on gender roles and modesty.
                  As a result,headcoverings, and the biblical meaning behind
                  them, have beenlost in the annals of history and stripped from
                  feminine culture.Consequently, most modern Christian women
                  have never evenheard of this biblical practice. If they have,
                  their story is similarto my wife, who thought it was a
                  tradition only continued by theAmish, Mennonites, and the
                  oppressed women of the MiddleEast.The feminist movement
                  throughout history has soughtto challenge and redefine
                  traditional gender roles, striving foregalitarianism and
                  individuality as opposed to the biblical order.This has led to
                  confusion and disorder in terms of gender iden-tity and roles.
                  However, it is important to remember that whilehistory has its
                  place, our ultimate authority lies in Scripture. Totruly
                  understand the issue at hand, we must look to Scripture</div>

        While a fair amount of effort has been spent on determining the sense of

        little attention has been given to how these two clauses fit into the
        broader context and argument of 1 Corinthians 11:2- 16. This is because
        Paul's overriding concern quite often has been reduced to that of
        flaunting social conventions thought to be unrecoverable due to
        ignorance of local Greco-Roman customs. Yet, current socio-historical
        data indicate that a breach of social etiquette is not really the core
        issue. Paul's line of argument suggests instead that the concern is
        theological and that gender based forms of worship are what is in
        question. are what is in question. If this is so, then it is actually <span

        Whenever the issue of the woman's head covering is brought up, people
        often dismiss the practice in one of<br>
        several ways. There are some who simply ignore the subject because, they
        say, there are different ways to<br>
        interpret the passage. Others avoid further discussion by saying that
        the head covering Paul refers to is just the<br>
        hair itself, and not a scarf or shawl worn over the hair. Many others
        insist that these instructions about head<br>
        covering applied only to the congregation in Corinth, and that the
        reasons for the head covering were due to<br>
        some local, cultural customs of the First Century that are irrelevant to
        Twentieth Century believers. Some<br>
        people dismiss the subject by saying that God is concerned with what is
        in the heart, and the head covering is<br>
        merely an unimportant outward symbol. Finally, there are some women who
        do not wear a head covering<br>
        simply because no other women in their congregation do it, and they fear
        they might project a "holier-than-thou"<br>
        image by wearing a head covering in a bareheaded congregation.</div>
      <div class="rt-scroll"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="rt-scroll">To the natural mind, a piece of cloth on a woman's
        head may seem to be a weak, foolish instrument for imparting divine
        revelation of God's authority to angelic and demonic beings. But the
        Bible tells us that God has chosen the foolish things of the world to
        confound the wise; and "God has chosen the weak things of the world to
        confound the things that are mighty" (1 Cor.1:27). Readers of the New
        Testament may recall that when "handkerchiefs or aprons" which Paul had
        touched were brought to the sick and the possessed, "the diseases left
        them and the evil spirits went out" (Ac.19:12). This passage confirms
        the fact that a piece of cloth can, indeed, be used as an instrument to
        display God's authority to evil spirits, and affect what happens in the
        spiritual realm, which in turn affects what takes place in the physical
        realm. Page 9 of 14 We do not need to understand all the mechanics of
        exactly how and why God's ways work, in order to walk in them, just as
        we do not need to understand all the mechanics of how and why a car
        works in order to drive it. If the car works, and we drive it according
        to the rules of the road, we can expect to reach our destination. God's
        ways work, and if we walk in them, we can expect results. What results
        can we expect to take place when God's authority is displayed to the
        angels, fallen and unfallen, by means of the woman's head covering? We
        will first look at the effect on the unfallen angels, and then the
        effect on the fallen.</div>

          Lambrecht contends that Paul's passage is intentionally structured
          into three sections—authority (verses 3–6), creation (verses 7–12),
          and nature (verses 13–15)—to argue that women should be in a
          subordinate role. He views the dual meaning of “head” as both the
          physical head and the source of authority, establishing that in
          worship women must cover their heads while men remain uncovered.
          Failure to comply (as seen in Corinth) brings disgrace, reinforcing
          distinct gender appearances in public worship.</div>

          <div>Theologian Daniel B. Wallace concludes that the head covering in
            1 Corinthians 11:2-16 is a real, physical covering rather than
            merely the woman's hair, arguing that if hair were considered the
            covering, then men would logically need to shave their heads, which
            does not align with the text's plain meaning. Wallace emphasizes
            that this practice is not just a cultural tradition but a binding
            one rooted in theology, as the term "traditions" (παραδόσεις) in
            verse 2 suggests obligations that are meant to be upheld by all. In
            Paul's time, head coverings were a common cultural practice, which
            the early Christian community adapted to give a distinctively
            Christian significance. However, in the contemporary context,
            wearing a head covering might be perceived as degrading or
            humiliating for women. Therefore, Wallace advocates for the need for
            a new, corresponding symbol that aligns with the spirit of the text
            while respecting current cultural norms. This symbol should be worn
            specifically when women are praying or prophesying publicly,
            maintaining the essence of submission and respect intended by the
            original practice.</div>

              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">According to Theologian Bob Deffinbaugh, Paul provides a clear instruction in 1 Corinthians 11:1-16 for women to cover their heads as a symbol of submission to God's appointed authority, particularly in the presence of angels and celestial beings: "To sum up verses 1-16, Paul is instructing women to cover their heads in order to demonstrate to the angels and celestial powers their submission to God’s appointed authority." This practice is not merely a cultural norm but is presented as an apostolic tradition, intended to be a universal practice across all churches, not just in Corinth: "Paul does not present head coverings as a matter of his opinion, but as an apostolic tradition." He further emphasizes, "He also speaks of the head covering of women as the consistent practice of every church and not just that of the Corinthian church."</p>
              <br>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">The scope of this command extends beyond the context of church meetings: "Some sincerely believe verses 1-16 refer to the church meeting. I believe Paul is speaking more generally so that his words apply both to the church meeting and elsewhere." Deffinbaugh notes, "The conclusion that the church meeting is in view is inferential at best." When Paul specifically refers to church meetings, he makes it explicitly clear, as seen in his references to gatherings in 1 Corinthians.</p>
              <br>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Cultural context, while helpful, is not essential for understanding these biblical principles: "The assumption is often made that we must first understand the cultural setting of a particular passage before we can understand or apply it. Knowing the cultural background of any text is helpful, but it is not mandatory." Deffinbaugh continues, "Even if interesting and enlightening, there is a reason why a knowledge of the culture of Corinth is not necessary. Head covering is a symbol, a symbol designed to convey a message both to men and to angels. The symbol of head covering does not derive from the culture of Corinth, or our own culture, but from the nature of the Godhead and the divine distinctions God has determined and defined."</p>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Head coverings are prescribed for specific situations: "Women should cover their heads when the angels are watching," "Women should cover their heads when they are praying or prophesying," "Women should cover their heads when they are engaged in exercising their priesthood as believers," "Women should cover their heads when the spiritual ministry in which they are engaged has a leadership or authoritative function or appearance," and "Women should cover their heads when their submission to male headship is not apparent."</p>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Deffinbaugh dismisses the idea that long hair or silence can act as substitutes for a head covering: "The fact that all women wear their hair longer than men (as a rule) is used as the premise on which Paul builds to show another reason why women should have their heads covered. In verse 6, Paul argues that if a woman will not cover her head, she should shave it. Thus, a woman’s long hair is not sufficient." Additionally, "Some contend that the woman’s silence is sufficient evidence of her submission. Thus, in the meeting of the church, if a woman is silent, a head covering is not required. But if silence is sufficient, then why does Paul not start with chapter 14 rather than conclude with it, for it is in chapter 14 that he calls for silence?"</p>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Deffinbaugh addresses the debate on legalism versus obedience: "I am hearing the word 'legalism' a lot lately, and I do not like what it implies. Legalism, of course, is wrong and ought to be avoided. But the solution is not to throw out all the rules or commands of Scripture." He further explains, "Women should cover their heads because Paul commands them to, and because of the principles of headship and of God’s sovereign distinctions. Legalism is keeping the rules for the rules’ sake. Christian liberty is keeping the rules for God’s sake, and with a heart and mind which seeks most of all to be pleasing to Him by obeying His commandments."</p>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">The nature of the head covering is also specified: "The Greek expressions used of the woman’s head covering seem to indicate that something more than a piece of cloth (or a hat) resting on the head is required. Not only should something be on the head, but something should hang down from the head to cover the hair."</p>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Modern resistance to this practice might be culturally driven: "Why is this simple act such a problem to so many today? Is it really that Paul’s meaning is so hard to grasp? Is it because we, individually or as a church, have not done it this way before?"</p>
              <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Deffinbaugh insists that the act of covering should be voluntary: "If the symbol is to be meaningful, it should be voluntarily worn, for submission is voluntary."</p>
              Ultimately, the core issue is obedience to God's commands: "First,
              Paul commands women to wear a head covering. We do not do well to
              ignore any command of God." Deffinbaugh concludes, "As we
              acknowledge and practice our submission to His headship, we
              announce to the world that He is Head of all. To the degree that
              we fail to obey this command (and others), we distort the image of
              God which we are privileged to symbolically display."</div>

                    <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Before we attempt to sum up Paul’s message and its implications for us, we must first call attention to a wrong conclusion which many evangelicals have reached, claiming that Paul’s words in verse 5 require it. This conclusion is plainly stated by F. F. Bruce and has been taken up recently by many others: That there was liberty in the church (for it is church order, not private or domestic devotion, that is in view here) for women to pray or prophesy is necessarily implied by Paul’s argument: he does not suggest that there is anything undesirable about their doing so (whatever the injunction of 14.34 means, it cannot be understood thus), but requires them to do so with their heads covered.20 It would seem that the symbol of head coverings is still understood as essential by Bruce, and we would surely think that Schreiner agrees: Nothing is clearer in verses 3-9 than that Paul wants the woman to wear a head covering because such adornment appropriately distinguishes women from men. Indeed, the focus on male headship over women in verse 3 shows that Paul wants women to wear a head covering in order to show that they are submissive to male headship.21 It does not take long for us to learn that while head covering was certainly applicable for Paul’s day, it is no longer appropriate for our own: For Paul the issue was directly tied to a cultural shame that scarcely prevails in most cultures today.22 Paul was concerned about head coverings only because of the message they sent to people in that culture. Today, except in certain religious groups, if a woman fails to wear a head covering while praying or prophesying, no one thinks she is in rebellion. Lack of head coverings sends no message at all in our culture.23 And so, when all is said and (not) done, we end up with this as the final outcome of Paul’s teaching: The principle still stands that women should pray and prophesy in a manner that makes it clear that they submit to male leadership. Clearly the attitude and the demeanor with which a woman prays and prophesies will be one indication of whether she is humble and submissive. The principle enunciated here should be applied in a variety of ways given the diversity of the human situation.24 Women everywhere are freed from Paul’s requirement of head coverings, and they can demonstrate their submission to the principle of male headship any way they think best. Let us step back momentarily to think about what has been concluded in general. I understand Paul’s teaching on the role of women to have at least these four major components: (1) The conduct of Christian men and women is to be governed by the principle of male headship in the home and in the church.</p>

                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Cultural and Symbolic Meaning:      Henry notes that in the Eastern countries of Paul's time, being veiled or covered signified either shame or subjection, which is opposite to Western customs where being bare-headed signifies subjection, and being covered indicates superiority.  Reprehension of Conduct:      He criticizes the practice of women praying or prophesying uncovered and men doing so covered, stating that the man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors Christ, and the woman who does so uncovered dishonors her head (the man).  Reasons for Reprehension:      Order and Subjection: Men are not to cover their heads as they are the image and glory of God, representing His dominion. Women, being the glory of the man, should reflect this by covering their heads, signifying their subjection.         "The man that prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonoureth his head, namely, Christ, the head of every man (1Co 11:3), by appearing in a habit unsuitable to the rank in which God has placed him."         "The woman, on the other hand, who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head, namely, the man, 1Co 11:3."      Natural Distinction: The woman's long hair is a natural covering and glory to her, whereas long hair on a man signifies softness and effeminacy, supporting the distinction in appearance between the sexes.         "The woman's hair is a natural covering; to wear it long is a glory to her; but for a man to have long hair, or cherish it, is a token of softness and effeminacy."      Divine Order: Women were made from and for men, thus should not act in a way that suggests equality or superiority over men in public worship.         "For the man was not made out of the woman, but the woman out of the man, 1Co 11:8."         "The woman was made for the man, to be his help-meet, and not the man for the woman."      Angelic Presence: Women should have a covering (symbolized as "power" on her head) because of the angels, either to protect against evil angels or out of reverence for good angels who might be present in worship.         "She ought to have power on her head, because of the angels."  Guarding Against Extreme Interpretations:      Henry cautions against taking the argument too far by noting that men and women are interdependent in the Lord, suggesting that authority should not lead to tyranny nor subjection to slavery.         "Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord."  Appeal to Custom and Decency:      He concludes by suggesting that those contentious about this issue should consider the customs and practices of all the churches, emphasizing that such practices are based on natural decency.         "He sums up all by referring those who were contentious to the usages and customs of the churches, 1Co 11:16."  In essence, Matthew Henry supports the practice of head coverings for women in worship as a sign of subjection and respect for divine order, while also stressing the importance of not overstepping the bounds of authority or subjection to the point of abuse or misunderstanding.</p>

                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Doctrine and Example:      The author acknowledges Paul's dual role as both a preacher of doctrine and a living example of how one should live. However, he stresses that only Christ's example should be followed without reservation, suggesting that human examples in Scripture should be emulated only to the extent they align with Christ's actions.  Public Assemblies and Head Coverings:      In discussing 1 Corinthians 11:2-16, the author emphasizes that the Christian's conduct, including in matters of dress (like head coverings), should not dishonor Christ. He sees the practice of head covering for women as a symbol of subjection to men, reflecting the divine order where women were made for the help and comfort of men.         "We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ."         "The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal."      The "power" on the woman's head, interpreted here as a veil, is suggested as necessary due to the presence of angels, which should encourage proper behavior in worship.         "She ought to have 'power,' that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels."      There's a strong emphasis on the mutual benefit and support between men and women, advocating for a balanced relationship where neither one dominates the other.         "Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant."  Cultural Adaptation and Christian Practice:      The author notes that Christian practice should harmonize with national customs unless they conflict with fundamental principles of truth and holiness. He sees no biblical support for "affected singularities" or practices that stand out without cause.         "The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible."</p>

                            <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">He situates the practice within the cultural norms of his time, noting that women in the church were to pray or prophesy with their heads veiled, while men should not cover their heads, as was customary among Greeks. Chrysostom states, "Their women used both to pray and prophesy unveiled and with their head bare, (for then women also used to prophesy;) but the men went so far as to wear long hair as having spent their time in philosophy, and covered their heads when praying and prophesying, each of which was a Grecian custom."  Symbol of Authority and Subjection:      For men, covering the head is seen as dishonoring Christ, who is their head: "Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head." This reflects the man's role as the image and glory of God, suggesting he should not cover his head to show his rule over the woman.     For women, not covering the head is dishonorable and akin to being shaven, which is considered shameful: "But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven." The covering symbolizes her subjection to her husband and divine order: "For this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels."  Natural Order and Decency:      Chrysostom uses nature to argue for the propriety of head coverings, where long hair is given to women as a natural covering but does not replace the need for an additional veil. He notes, "But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering." This indicates that the covering should be intentional, acknowledging her subjection by choice.  Angelic Influence:      The mention of angels is used to stress the importance of modesty and propriety in worship, suggesting that women should be covered not only for human propriety but also in reverence to spiritual beings: "For this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels."  Behavior Beyond Symbolism:      Chrysostom extends the discussion to the behavior of women, encouraging modesty and shamefacedness in all aspects of life, reinforcing that the head covering is not just a physical act but a reflection of inner disposition.  Against Contentiousness:      He rebukes those who oppose these practices, suggesting that such opposition is not based on reason but on stubbornness: "But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the Churches of God."</p>

Concerning Women's Head- Coverings (11:2-16) Verses 2-16 of chapter 11 are devoted to the subject of women's head-cov- erings. The remaining verses deal with abuses in connection with the Lord's Supper (vv. 17-34). The first section of 1 Corinthians 11  the chapter has been much disputed. Some think that the instruction given here was applicable only to Paul's day. Some even go so far as to contend that these verses reflect Paul's prejudice against women, since he was a bachelor! Still others simply accept the teaching of this portion, seeking to obey its precepts even if they do not understand them all. 11:2 The apostle first of all com- mends the Corinthians for the way in which they remembered him in all things, and held fast the traditions just as he had delivered them. Traditions refer not to habits and practices that have arisen in the church down through the years, but rather, in this case, to the inspired instructions of the Apostle Paul. 11:3 Paul now introduces the sub- ject of women's head coverings. Behind his instruction is the fact that every or- dered society is built on two pillars - authority and subjection to that au- thority. It is impossible to have a well- functioning community where these two principles are not observed. Paul men- tions three great relationships involving authority and subjection. First, the head of every man is Christ; Christ is Lord and man is subject to Him. Secondly, the head of woman is man; the place of headship was given to the man, and the woman is under his authority. Third, the head of Christ is God; even in the God- head, One Person has the place of rule and Another takes the place of willing subordination. These examples of head- ship and submission were designed by God Himself and are fundamental in His arrangement of the universe. At the outset it should be empha- sized that subjection does not mean in- feriority. Christ is subject to God the Fa- ther but He is not inferior to Him. Neither is woman inferior to man, though she is subordinate to him. 11:4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dis- honors his head, that is, Christ. It is say- ing, in effect, that the man does not ac- knowledge Christ as his head. Thus it is an act of gross disrespect. 11:5 Every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, that is, the man. She is saying, in effect, that she does not recognize man's God-given headship and will not submit to it.  1785  If this were the only verse in the Bible on the subject, then it would imply that it is all right for a woman to pray or prophesy in the assembly as long as she has a veil or other covering on her head. But Paul teaches clsewhere that women should be silent in the assembly (1 Cor. 14:34), that they are not permitted to teach or to have authority over the man but to be in silence (1 Tim. 2:12). Actually meetings of the assembly do not come into view until verse 17, so the instructions concerning the head-cover- ing in verses 2-16 cannot be confined to church meetings. They apply to whenever a woman prays or prophesies. She prays silently in the assembly, since 1 Timothy 2:8 limits public prayer to the men (lit., males). She prays audibly or silently at other times. She prophesies when she teaches other women (Titus 2:3-5) or chil- dren in the Sunday school. 11:6 If a woman is not covered, she might as well be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, then she should be covered. The unveiled head of a woman is as shameful as if her hair were cut off. The apostle is not commanding a barber's op- eration but rather telling what moral consistency would require! 11:7 In verses 7-10, Paul teaches the subordination of the woman to the man by going back to creation. This should forever lay to rest any idea that his teaching about women's covering was what was culturally suitable in his day but not applicable to us today. The headship of man and the sub- jection of woman have been God's order from the very beginning. First of all, man is the image and glory of God whereas woman is the glory of man. This means that man was placed on earth as God's representative, to exercise dominion over it. Man's un- covered head is a silent witness to this fact. The woman was never given this place of headship; instcad she is the glory of man in the sense that she "ren- ders conspicuous the authority of man," as W. E. Vine expresses it.» Man indeed ought not to cover his head in prayer; it would be tantamount to veiling the glory of God, and this would be an insult to the Divine Majesty. 11:8 Paul next reminds us that man was not created from woman but woman was created from man. The man was first, then the woman was taken from his side. This priority of the man strength-1 Corinthians 11 way He did not give to man. There is a spiritual significance to this. It teaches that when a woman prays to God, she should wear a covering on her head. What is true in the natural sphere should be true in the spiritual. 11:16 The apostle closes this section with the statement: "But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God." Does Paul mean, as has been sug- gested, that the things he has just been saying are not important enough to con- tend about? Does he mean that there was no such custom of women veiling their heads in the churches? Does he mean that these teachings are optional and not to be pressed upon women as the commandments of the Lord? It seems strange that any such interpreta- tions would ever be offered, yet they are commonly heard today. This would mean that Paul considered these instruc- tions as of no real consequence, and he had just been wasting over half a chapter of Holy Scripture in setting them forth! There are at least two possible expla- nations of this verse which fit in with the rest of the Scripture. First of all, the apostle may be saying that he anticipates that certain ones will be contentious about these matters, but he adds that we have no such custom, that is, the custom of contending about this. We do not argue about such matters, but accept them as the teaching of the Lord. An- other interpretation, favored by William Kelly, is that Paul was saying that the churches of God did not have any such custom as that of women praying or prophesying without being covered. D. Concerning the Lord's Supper (11:17-34) 11:17 The apostle rebukes the Co- rinthians for the fact that there were di- visions among them as they gathered to- gether (vv. 17-19). Note the repetition of the expression "when you come to- gether" or related words (11:17, 18, 20, 33, 34; 14:23, 26). In 11:2 Paul had had occasion to praise them for keeping the traditions which he had delivered to them, but there was one matter in which he could not praise them, and that is the matter about which he is to speak. When  1787  they gathered together for public meet- ings, they came together not for the bet- ter but for the worse. This is a solemn reminder to us all that it is possible to go away from meetings of the church and to have been harmed rather than benefited. 11:18 The first cause of rebuke was the existence of divisions or schisms. This does not mean that parties had bro- ken away from the church and formed separate fellowships, but rather that there were cliques and factions within the congregation. A schism is a party in- side, whereas a sect is a different party outside. Paul could believe these reports of divisions because he knew that the Corinthians were in a carnal state, and he had previous occasion in this Epistle to rebuke them because of their divi- sions. F. B. Hole writes: Paul was prepared to give at least partial credence to the reports of the divisions at Corinth, since he knew that, owing to their carnal state, there were bound to be these opinionated factions in their midst. Here Paul reasons forward from their state to their actions. Knowing them to be carnal and walking as men, he knew that they would certainly fall victims to the in- veterate tendency of the human mind to form its strong opinions, and the factions founded in those opinions, ending in the schisms and divisions. He knew, too, that God could overrule their folly and take occasion to make manifest those that were approved of Him, walking according to the Spirit and not as man; and conse- quently eschewing the whole of this divi- sive business.» 11:19 Paul foresaw that the schisms already begun in Corinth would increase until they became more serious. Al- though in general this would be detri- mental to the church, yet one good thing would come out of it, that is, that those who were truly spiritual and who were approved of God would be recognized among the Corinthians. When Paul says in this verse: "there must also be fac- tions" among you," this does not mean that it is a moral" necessity. God is not condoning splits in the church here. Rather, Paul means that because of the carnal conditions of the Corinthians, it was inevitable that factions would re-</p>

                                      <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Paul was talking in the context of authority, because everyone has his being from God, albeit through Christ. A woman also has her being through Christ, but as she was made from man, she is subordinate to her husband. The Father is rightly called the head of Christ because he begat him, but Christ is head of a man in one way, a man is head of a woman in another, and God is the head of Christ in yet another. God is the head of Christ because Christ was begotten of him, Christ is the head of the man because he created him, and the man is the head of the woman because she was taken from his side. Christ is the head of a man because Adam was created by him out of nothing. Thus one expression has different meanings, according to the difference of person and substance.</p>

                                      <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">To pray is to make intercession, and to prophesy is to proclaim the future coming of the Lord in symbolic terms, after prayer.</p>

                                      <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">5but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head-it is the same as if her head were shaven. 'For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil. 7For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.</p>
                                      <br>
                                      <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Although man and woman are of the same substance, the man has priority because he is the head of the woman. He is greater than she is by cause and order, not by substance. The woman is inferior to the man because she is part of him, for her origin is in the man. She was created out of him, and for that reason a woman is under obligation to her husband and is subject to his control. Paul says that the honor and dignity of a man makes it wrong for him to cover his head, because the image of God should not be hidden. Indeed, it ought not to be hidden, for the glory of God is seen in the man.</p>
                                      <br>
                                      <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">There is an enormous distance between the glory of God and the glory of a man, for a man is formed in the likeness of God and a woman is not. She is the likeness of God because of the man. God created only one human being, so that just as all things come from the one God, all human beings come from the one man. The result is that one man bears on earth the likeness of the one invisible God, so that the one God would see the authority of the single originating principle being maintained. This would be to the consternation of the devil, who wanted to claim lordship and divinity for himself, to the detriment of the one God. The prophet Ezekiel alludes to this, as does the apostle, when he says: So that he sits in the temple of God, flaunting himself as if he were God.</p>

                                      <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">The veil signifies power, and the angels are bishops, as it says in the Revelation of John, where, because they are men, they are criticized for not rebuking the people, though good behavior on their part is also praised. A woman therefore ought to cover her head, because she is not the likeness of God but is under subjection. Because transgression began with her, she ought to indicate this by covering her head in church out of reverence for the bishop. Nor should she speak, because the bishop takes the place of Christ. In front of him, and because he is the representative of Christ, she ought to appear as she would before a judge, as one under subjection, because of the way the sin of which we are guilty originated.</p>

                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians written in the first century ce, in which he declared that men should pray with an uncovered head but that women should have their heads covered as a sign of feminine submission. 2 This idea was taken up and developed by subsequent authors, who also extended it beyond prayer. Clement of Alexandria (c.150–c.215) wrote that women should be entirely covered unless at home, and Tertullian (c.155–c.220) considered that girls ought to take up the veil at puberty. 3 John Chrysostom (c.347–407) and Cyril of Alexandria (c.376–444) both judged veils essential parts of women’s clothing, the latter even describing covering the female head as part of natural law. 4 Early Christian writers presented a largely united front: modest Christian women ought to cover their heads not only during prayer but as part of everyday dress. Drawing on this tradition, an assumption has developed in scholarship that veiling became a social requirement in the fourth century when Christianity became the official religion and the ideas of churchmen gained increasing influence.</p>
                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Veiling, however, was not an innovation of early Christianity. For centuries women across the Mediterranean had worn veils of all kinds, and much scholarship has examined these practices, particularly in the Greek world but also in the ancient Near East and the Roman empire. 5 While these practices differed signifi- cantly across time and place, veils were generally used as items of female dress that expressed modesty and piety. What makes Late Antiquity stand out is that there are so many surviving texts that speak explicitly about the importance of veiling, describe how it ought to be practised, and criticize women who were perceived not to be veiling properly (or at all). These texts are also unequivocal about the theological significance of veiling: veiling expressed modesty and piety, but also signified feminine submission and inferiority to men in the eyes of God. </p>
                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Within modern scholarship, veiling is therefore understandably often perceived as a symbol of the oppression of the Church, a sign that the relative religious liberality of the Roman world was giv- ing way to the dominance of Christianity over medieval society. 6 Were veiling practices really as simple as the Church Fathers make them seem? In a more nuanced analysis of women’s dress, Mary Harlow concluded that covering the head in Late Antiquity was ‘haphazard’ in visual culture and that there appears to have been no clear rule about whether women should cover.7</p>
                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">This presents us with two contrasting pictures of veiling: strict religious codes of dress on one side and the almost random use of veils on the other. How do we reconcile these ideas? Does either accurately reflect women’s experiences of veiling or wider social expectations? This article argues that neither provides a satisfactory understanding of the complexity and controversy of veiling practices. </p>
                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Evidence primarily drawn from visual culture, which shows that women neither adhered strictly to the expectations of the Church Fathers, nor used veiling as an arbitrary sartorial choice. Veils were deeply intersectional and situational garments that were used variously to express differences in age, status and occupation, and to mark different occasions and life-stages. Their use also varied across different communities and across time. Finally, but no less importantly, they were also fashion items: their development into elite acces- sories around the turn of the fifth century can be traced partic- ularly clearly.</p>
                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Church Fathers advocated a specifically religious interpreta- tion of a practice that was already centuries old. Together their voices may have been unanimous, but their rhetoric was fighting against deeply ingrained and diverse social practices. The apparent dissonance between texts and images does not render texts ‘mis- leading’ or incorrect, but rather sheds new light on the contested development of veiling and attempts to enforce it.</p>
                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">Both tight and loose styles were used throughout the fourth to seventh centuries. 29 Examples of all types of cover In terms of regional distinctions, there is no discernible differ- ence in veiling practices between the east and the west. This is interesting given that the eastern Mediterranean had a much longer tradition of veiling than the west and may therefore be expected to have taken up Christian veiling with greater alacrity. Indeed, it seems that, with one notable exception discussed fur- ther below, the status of the woman, the context of the image, and the date of its creation were all better indicators of whether she was shown wearing a veil than her location.</p>

                                          <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="break-words">For early Christian writers interested in veiling, the issue of women covering their heads was primarily, if not solely, a sim- ple moral concern: good, modest, pious women veiled. The results of this analysis of veiling practices in Late Antiquity help to explain why this topic became so fraught and why authors returned to it again and again. These men fundamentally failed, or refused, to understand that the practice of covering the head incorporated a much wider range of micropractices than they recognized, many of them related to the mundane realities of everyday life. Their expectations of women thus seem to have rarely accorded with what they saw around them. The visual evidence does not simply expose these men’s writings as an overly simplistic representation of ideas about veiling, but rather reveals a broader conflict between churchmen and ordinary people. The Church Fathers were united in promoting veils as a Christian symbol, but in doing so they were swimming against the tide of centuries of tradition.</p>

                                                    view—and reassesses earlier
                                                    proposals that Paul
                                                    introduced a Jewish veiling
                                                    custom into a culturally
                                                    diverse Corinthian setting.
                                                    In his analysis, Massey
                                                    shows that married women in
                                                    ritual contexts were
                                                    expected to adhere to a
                                                    normative dress code that
                                                    incorporated both a material
                                                    head covering and the
                                                    display of their natural
                                                    long hair. As he states,
                                                    “there is no contradiction
                                                    in the Greek language if a
                                                    woman wears plaited or
                                                    braided hair accompanied by
                                                    the accessory of a veil”
                                                    (Massey, p.72), and he
                                                    further concludes that the
                                                    evidence “does not support a
                                                    reading in which long hair
                                                    and veiling are mutually
                                                    exclusive; instead, they
                                                    indicate that a woman’s
                                                    natural long hair—her
                                                    glory—is intended to be
                                                    modestly displayed beneath a
                                                    textile covering” (Massey,
                                                    p.74). Consequently, the
                                                    study concludes that the
                                                    dress code described in
                                                    1 Corinthians 11.2–16 should
                                                    be understood as reflecting
