      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>The first Christians gathered in homes, sharing meals and celebrating
          the Eucharist. Over time, these practices evolved into structured
          liturgies (The legalization of Christianity under Constantine in 313
          AD, and the establishment as the state religion of the Roman Empire in
          380 AD). </p>
        <p>Pre-Nicene Worship practices were rooted in the communal and
          liturgical traditions of the apostolic era, blending Jewish liturgical
          customs with distinct Christian theological emphases.</p>
        <p>The sources that attest to such a structure can be found in The New
          Testament (1st Century), The Didache (Late 1st–Early 2nd Century),
          Pliny the Younger (Early 2nd Century),&nbsp; Justin Martyr (Mid-2nd
          Century), The Epistle of Barnabas (Early 2nd Century),&nbsp; Ignatius
          of Antioch (Early 2nd Century),<span style="color: #2c3e50;"></span><span

            style="color: #2c3e50;"> </span>Hippolytus of Rome (Early 3rd
          Century), Tertullian (Late 2nd–Early 3rd Century).</p>
        <p>Pliny the Younger, in his <em>Epistles</em> (10.96), describes
          Christians meeting before dawn on a fixed day, singing hymns to
          Christ, and binding themselves to ethical commitments, such as
          avoiding fraud, theft, adultery, and breaking promises. </p>
      </div>
      <h1 id="worship-practices">Gathering of the Community</h1>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>Baptized Christians, including men, women, and children, gathered on
          Sunday, known as the "Lord’s Day," to celebrate Jesus’ resurrection.
          This practice originated in the <em>New Testament</em> (1st century),
          where believers met on the first day of the week to break bread, as
          recorded in Acts 20:7. Pliny the Younger, in his <em>Epistles</em>
          (10.96), notes that Christians met before dawn on a fixed day, singing
          hymns to Christ and committing to ethical practices, such as avoiding
          fraud, theft, and adultery.</p>
        <p>These gatherings took place in private homes or informal spaces, as
          there were no dedicated church buildings at the time, as described by
          Justin Martyr in his <em>First Apology</em> (67). The primary purpose
          of these meetings was to commemorate Jesus’ resurrection and to
          strengthen the unity of the Christian community. </p>
        <p>Christians came together joyfully, as the <em>Epistle of Barnabas</em>
          states, "We keep the eighth day [Sunday] with joy" (15:9). This weekly
          assembly was a central practice, uniting believers in faith and
          fellowship, and celebrating Christ’s victory over death.</p>
        <p>The didicate: "For all the time of your trust will not profit you, if
          you do not become complete in the last season": and "You will gather
          together often" </p>
        <p></p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h1 id="worship-practices">Scripture Readings</h1>
        <p>A designated reader proclaimed the texts aloud to the congregation.
          This role ensured that the scriptures were heard and understood by all
          members of the community, regardless of their ability to read. The
          practice of public reading is rooted in the <em>New Testament</em>,
          where Paul instructs that his letters be read aloud to the entire
          church. For example, in Colossians 4:16, Paul writes, "After this
          letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of
          the Laodiceans, and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea."
          Similarly, in 1 Thessalonians 5:27, Paul charges the community, "I
          charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the
          brothers and sisters."</p>
        <p>The readings included the "memoirs of the apostles," likely the
          Gospels, and the writings of the prophets from the Old Testament.
          Justin Martyr, in his <em>First Apology</em> (67), specifically
          mentions that "the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the
          prophets are read." This practice reflects the continuity with Jewish
          synagogue worship, where readings from the Law (Torah) and the
          Prophets were central. The <em>New Testament</em> also emphasizes the
          importance of scripture, as seen in 1 Timothy 4:13, where Paul
          instructs Timothy, "Devote yourself to the public reading of
          Scripture, to preaching, and to teaching."</p>
        <p>The readings were conducted in private homes or informal gathering
          spaces, as there were no dedicated church buildings at the time.
          Justin Martyr, in his <em>First Apology</em> (67), confirms that
          early Christians met in such spaces. This practice is consistent with
          the <em>New Testament</em>, where believers gathered in homes for
          worship, as seen in passages like Romans 16:5, where Paul greets the
          church that meets in Priscilla and Aquila’s house.</p>
        <p>The primary purpose of the scripture readings was to instruct and
          remind the community of Christ’s teachings and God’s promises. They
          provided the basis for the sermon and communal prayers that followed,
          helping believers grow in their faith. The readings also connected the
          community to the broader narrative of salvation history, linking Old
          Testament prophecies to their fulfillment in Christ. This purpose is
          echoed in the <em>New Testament</em>, where Paul writes in 2 Timothy
          3:16, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching,
          rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness."</p>
        <p>The reader stood and proclaimed the texts aloud from scrolls or
          codices. This practice, inherited from Jewish synagogue worship,
          ensured that the scriptures were accessible to all, regardless of
          literacy. Justin Martyr, in his <em>First Apology</em> (67),
          emphasizes that these readings were central to the liturgy and were
          followed by a sermon expounding on the texts. The <em>New Testament</em>
          also highlights the importance of public reading, as seen in
          Revelation 1:3, which states, "Blessed is the one who reads aloud the
          words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to
          heart what is written in it."</p>

        <h1 id="worship-practices">Sermon</h1>
        <p>The bishop or presbyter (president of the assembly) delivered a

        <blockquote>
          <p>"When the reader has finished, the president verbally instructs and
            exhorts to the imitation of these good things."</p>
          <p>- Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The sermon served to instruct and encourage believers in their faith,
          applying the scripture readings to their lives.</p>

            located."</p>
          <p>- Tertullian, <em>Apology</em> 16</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Prayers included intercessions for the church, the world, and those
          in need. Justin Martyr notes that these prayers were offered "with one
          heart and one voice" [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67].</p>

          <p>Baptized Christians, including men, women, and children, gathered
            together to worship and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. They
            assembled on Sunday, referred to as the "Lord’s Day," often early in
            the morning [Pliny the Younger, <em>Epistles</em> 10.96; <em>Epistle
              of Barnabas</em> 15:9]. Meetings took place in private homes or
            other informal gathering spaces, since dedicated church buildings
            did not yet exist [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67]. The
            purpose of these gatherings was to commemorate Jesus’ resurrection
            and to strengthen the bonds of the Christian community.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"They met on a fixed day before dawn and sang responsively a hymn
              to Christ as to a god, bound themselves with an oath—not to some
              crime—but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not to break a
              promise, and not to deny a deposit when called upon. After this,
              it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of
              food—ordinary and innocent food."</p>
            <p>- Pliny the Younger, <em>Epistles</em> 10.96</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>

              also rose from the dead."</p>
            <p>- <em>Epistle of Barnabas</em> 15:9</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This weekly assembly was a central practice, uniting believers in
            faith and fellowship. The assembly was a joyful celebration of

            writings [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 65–67].</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>The <em>Didache</em> provides a Eucharistic prayer:</p>

        <p>Worship typically began with scripture readings from the "memoirs of
          the apostles" (likely the Gospels) and the prophets, a practice
          inherited from Jewish synagogue worship. These readings formed the
          foundation for teaching and reflection. A sermon followed, delivered
          by a bishop or presbyter, expounding on the texts and applying them to
          the lives of the congregation. This emphasized the didactic purpose of
          worship, instructing believers in the faith. The congregation then
          offered communal prayers, standing and facing east to symbolize the
          expectation of Christ’s return. These prayers, offered "with one heart
          and one voice," included intercessions for the church, the world, and
          those in need. The central act of worship was the Eucharist, where
          bread and wine were consecrated by the bishop through prayers of
          thanksgiving and shared among the baptized. Justin specifies that only
          those living in accordance with Christian teachings could partake, as
          the elements were understood as the body and blood of Christ.</p>

        <p>Early Christian worship was simple and communal. Services began with
          scripture readings and sermons, followed by prayers and the Eucharist.
          Justin Martyr, in the mid-2nd century, described this structure:
          readings from the apostles' memoirs and prophets, a sermon, communal
          prayers, and the sharing of bread and wine.</p>
        <p>Baptism was a key initiation rite. Candidates renounced Satan,
          professed faith, and were baptized naked in water. After baptism, they
          were clothed in white robes, anointed with oil, and participated in
          the Eucharist. This symbolized their new life in Christ.</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>Early Christians met in private homes, where they sang hymns, read
          scriptures, and commemorated the Last Supper. These gatherings were
          informal, often with animals present. The first churches were simple,
          built of heavy stones with few windows, and sometimes included
          defensive towers due to persecution.</p>
        <p>The earliest known church, built in the late 3rd century in Aila
          (modern-day Aqaba, Jordan), featured a central nave, side aisles, and
          an altar. The Dura-Europos church in Syria, dating to the mid-3rd
          century, is one of the earliest identified Christian house churches.</p>

        <p>The Eucharist was central to early Christian liturgy. Justin Martyr
          described it as a thank offering, with the president offering prayers
          and thanksgivings, and the congregation responding with "Amen." The
          bread and wine were distributed to all, and deacons carried the
          consecrated elements to those unable to attend.</p>
        <p>Fasting was also important, especially before Easter. Initially, the
          fast lasted one day but was later extended to 40 hours, symbolizing
          Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness. Sunday, the "little Easter," was a
          day of joy, often preceded by fasting on Wednesday and Friday.</p>

        <p>Early Christian worship was deeply communal, centered on the
          Eucharist, and marked by simplicity. Over time, as Christianity
          spread, worship practices became more structured, laying the
          foundation for the liturgy that would shape Christian worship for
          centuries.</p>
