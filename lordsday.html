        <!--      <div class="header-container"><br>
     <div class="header-text">       <p><em>In the year of our Lord 2025, on the third day of January...</em></p>     </div>   </div>   -->There
        were nine primary activities that occurred in sequence on the Lord's
        Day: the Assembly for Worship, Scripture Readings, Teaching, Hymns and
        Singing, Communal Prayer, Confession and Repentance, the Eucharist,
        Offering for the Needy, and Closing Hymns with Dismissal.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">This researched article provides a
        composite view of early Christian (Pre-325 AD) worship practices
        primarily from the Mediterranean Basin, encompassing regions such as
        Rome, North Africa, Asia Minor, and Syria, reflecting a blend of local
        traditions and apostolic teachings.</p>
      <h1>1. Assembly for Worship</h1>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Baptized Christians, including men,
          women, and children, gathered on Sunday, known as the "Lord’s Day," to
          celebrate Jesus’ resurrection. This practice originated in the New
          Testament (1st century), where believers met on the first day of the
          week to break bread, as recorded in Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 16:2, and
          Revelation 1:10.</p>
        <p><strong>Order and Unity in Worship</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the First Epistle of Clement, Clement
          notes the importance of order and unity in Christian gatherings. He
          encourages believers to come together in harmony, reflecting the peace
          and order of God’s creation. This sense of unity was vital for
          maintaining the integrity of the community. Similarly, in the Epistle
          of Polycarp to the Philippians, Polycarp urges believers to remain
          steadfast in their faith and to gather regularly for worship, prayer,
          and mutual encouragement.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pliny the Younger’s Observations</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The Roman magistrate Pliny the Younger,
          in his Epistles (10.96), provides an outsider’s perspective on early
          Christian practices. He notes that Christians met before dawn on a
          fixed day (Sunday), singing hymns to Christ and committing to ethical
          practices, such as avoiding fraud, theft, and adultery. These
          gatherings were marked by a solemn oath to live upright lives, a
          commitment to Christ’s teachings. Pliny also observed that
          Christianity had spread widely, affecting people of all ranks, ages,
          and genders, not only in cities but also in villages and rural areas.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Setting of Gatherings</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Gatherings took place in private homes
          or informal spaces, as there were no dedicated church buildings at the
          time. Justin Martyr, in his First Apology (67), describes these
          meetings as intimate and communal.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The primary purpose of these gatherings
          was to worship Christ, share in the Eucharist, and encourage one
          another in faith. The Epistle of Barnabas captures the joy of these
          meetings, stating: "Wherefore also we keep the eighth day [Sunday] for
          rejoicing, in the which also Jesus rose from the dead, and having been
          manifested ascended into the heavens." (15:9).</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h1 id="worship-practices">2. Scripture Readings</h1>
        <p><b>The Role of the Reader</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The reader (often referred to as a
          "lector") was a designated individual responsible for proclaiming
          Scripture aloud during the Lord's Day gatherings The position of
          lector was recognized as an official role in the community, and it was
          considered both a practical and spiritual function (Tertullian, De
          Praescriptione, c. 200; Hippolytus, Apostolic Tradition, c. 215).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The lector's task was to read as long as
          time permitted. This ensured that the congregation, including those
          who were illiterate, could hear and understand the Scriptures (<em>Justin
            Martyr, First Apology</em> 1.67). </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> The lector was viewed as ranking among
          the inspired orders, comparable to the prophets, which emphasized the
          sacred nature of this role. Ordination prayers specifically mentioned
          the lector's mission to make the Scriptures comprehensible and
          spiritually meaningful to the gathered assembly (<em>Didascalia
            Apostolorum</em> 2.20; <em>Apostolic Constitutions</em> 8.22). </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"> The practice of public reading is
          rooted in the New Testament, as seen in Colossians 4:16, where Paul
          instructs that his letters be read in different churches, and in 1
          Thessalonians 5:27, where he charges the community to ensure his
          letter is read to all believers. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Content of the Readings<br>
          </b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Justin Martyr, in his First
          Apology (67), he states on the content: "The memoirs of the apostles
          or the writings of the prophets are read." The readings included few
          main categories:</p>
        <ul>
          
          <li><b>Memoirs of the Apostles</b>: The Gospels recounted the life,
            teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus in the books of Matthew,
            Mark, and Luke.</li>
          <li><b>The Writings of the Prophets</b>: Selections from the Old
            Testament, particularly the prophetic books that foretold the coming
            of Christ. Passages from prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel
            were read.</li>
          <li><b>Apostolic letters</b>: (e.g., Paul’s epistles)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h1 id="worship-practices">3. Teaching (Sermon)</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The sermon occurred immediately after
          the scripture readings, forming a seamless transition from the
          proclamation of the Word to its interpretation and application.<b><br>
          </b></p>
        <p><b>Who Delivered the Sermon?</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The bishop or presbyter (also called the
          "president of the assembly") was responsible for delivering the
          sermon. This role was central to the liturgical leadership of the
          community. The bishop, as the chief pastor, was seen as the spiritual
          authority and teacher, often described as the "image of Christ" for
          the congregation [Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Magnesians</em>
          6:1].</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, prophets or teachers with
          recognized spiritual gifts also contributed to the teaching, though
          their roles were increasingly overseen by the bishop to maintain
          doctrinal unity [Didache 11-13; 1 Corinthians 12:28].</p>
        <p><b>What Was the Content of the Sermon?</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The sermon was an exposition of the
          scripture readings that had just been proclaimed. The leader explained
          the meaning of the texts, often drawing connections between the Old
          Testament prophecies and their fulfillment in Christ, as well as
          applying the teachings to the daily lives of the congregation [Justin
          Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67].</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The sermon aimed to instruct believers
          in the faith, encourage them in their spiritual journey, and exhort
          them to live according to Christ’s teachings. It often included moral
          exhortations, calls to repentance, and reminders of the hope of
          eternal life [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; 2 Timothy
          4:2].</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Justin Martyr describes this practice in
          his <em>First Apology</em> (67): "When the reader has ceased, the
          president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these
          good things" [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67].</p>
        <p><b>Why Was the Sermon Important?</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The sermon served multiple purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Instruction</b>: It provided theological and ethical teaching,
            helping believers understand the scriptures and their relevance to
            their lives [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67; 2 Timothy
            3:16-17].</li>
          <li><b>Encouragement</b>: It strengthened the faith of the community,
            especially in the face of persecution and challenges [Hebrews
            10:24-25].</li>
          <li><b>Exhortation</b>: It called believers to live holy lives,
            reflecting the teachings of Christ in their actions and
            relationships [Titus 2:11-12].</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The sermon was also a means of
          preserving doctrinal unity and countering heresies, as the bishop or
          presbyter ensured that the teachings aligned with apostolic tradition
          [Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Letter to the Ephesians</em> 6:1].</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How Was the Sermon Delivered?</b></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The leader typically spoke
          extemporaneously, relying on the guidance of the Holy Spirit and their
          knowledge of scripture. However, some sermons may have been prepared
          in advance, especially for special occasions or to address specific
          issues within the community. The style of preaching was often
          expository, focusing on explaining the meaning of the scriptures, and
          paraenetic, highlighting the need for moral exhortation and practical
          application. The sermon included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Narrative elements</b>: Recounting the acts of God in salvation
            history [Acts 7:2-53; Hebrews 11:1-40].</li>
          <li><b>Theological reflections</b>: Explaining the nature of God,
            Christ, and the Holy Spirit [John 1:1-18; Colossians 1:15-20].</li>
          <li><b>Ethical instructions</b>: Calling believers to live in love,
            humility, and holiness [Ephesians 4:1-3; 1 Peter 1:15-16].</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The congregation responded with "Amen"
          to affirm the message, as described by Justin Martyr: "When the
          president has given thanks, and all the people have expressed their
          assent, saying Amen..." [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 65].</p>
        <h1>4. Hymns and Singing</h1>
        <div class="">
          <h2>What Was Sung?</h2>
          <p>The congregation sang hymns to Christ, including:<strong><br>
            </strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #010101;"><strong>Psalms</strong>:
              Early Christians sang psalms from Jewish tradition, reinterpreting
              them through the lens of Christ’s life and mission. They were
              encouraged to worship with “psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,”
              making melody in their hearts to the Lord (Ephesians 5:19, LSV).<strong></strong></span></p>
          <span style="color: #010101;"> </span>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #010101;"><strong>Early
                Christian Hymns</strong>: New Testament passages like
              Philippians 2:6–11, describing Christ’s humility and equality with
              God, and Colossians 1:15–20, proclaiming Him as the image of the
              invisible God and the firstborn over creation, are thought to be
              early hymns sung by the church.<strong></strong></span></p>
          <span style="color: #010101;"> </span>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #010101;"><strong>Spiritual
                Songs</strong>: These were Spirit-inspired songs, either
              spontaneous or composed, used to praise God, give thanks, and
              share theological truths. As 1 Corinthians 14:26 notes, gatherings
              included hymns, teachings, and revelations. Pliny the Younger also
              observed that Christians sang hymns to Christ as to a god (<em>Epistles</em>
              10.96).</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="=">
          <h2>How Was the Singing Conducted?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><span style="color: #030303;"><b>Congregations sang hymns to
                  Christ</b>, often meeting before dawn to sing responsively a
                hymn to Christ as to a god (Pliny the Younger, <em>Epistles</em>
                10.96, c. 112 AD). </span></li>
            <span style="color: #030303;"> </span>
            <li><span style="color: #030303;"><b>Singing was characterized by
                  simplicity</b>, typically performed a cappella without
                instrumental accompaniment (Aniol, 2015, <em>What Was Early
                  Church Worship Music Like?</em>). </span></li>
            <span style="color: #030303;"> </span>
            <li><span style="color: #030303;"><b>The hymns were chanted or sung
                  in a melodic style</b>, reflecting the musical traditions of
                the time (Aniol, 2015, <em>What Was Early Church Worship Music
                  Like?</em>). </span></li>
            <span style="color: #030303;"> </span>
            <li><span style="color: #030303;"><b>Antiphonal singing, where two
                  groups alternated, was a common practice</b>, as encouraged in
                Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16. This method, rooted in
                Jewish worship, involved alternating groups singing or reciting
                psalms or hymns (Aniol, 2015, <em>What Was Early Church Worship
                  Music Like?</em>). </span></li>
            <span style="color: #030303;"> </span>
            <li><span style="color: #030303;">The focus was on communal
                participation and the expression of theological truths through
                music (Aniol, 2015, <em>What Was Early Church Worship Music
                  Like?</em>). </span></li>

        <b>What Were the Prayers About?</b></div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;"><br>
      </div>
      <ul>

        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The unity and growth of the church [John 17:20-23; Ephesians 4:3-6].</li>
        <li>Civil authorities and the well-being of society [1 Timothy 2:1-2].</li>
        <li>Those in need, such as the sick, the poor, and the persecuted [James
          5:13-16; Acts 12:5].</li>
        <li>The community offered prayers of gratitude for God’s blessings,
          including creation, redemption, and daily provisions [Psalm 100:4; 1
          Thessalonians 5:18; Didache 10:3].</li>
        <li>The congregation praised God for His holiness, power, and love,
          often using scriptural language and imagery [Psalm 145:1-3; Revelation
          4:8; Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67].</li>
        <li>Believers asked for God’s guidance, protection, and strength to live
          according to His will [Matthew 6:9-13; Philippians 4:6-7].</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> Justin Martyr, in his <em>First
          Apology</em> (67), describes these prayers as part of the Sunday
        worship service: We all rise together and pray"* [Justin Martyr, <em>First
          Apology</em> 67]. Tertullian, in his <em>Apology</em> (39), also
        notes that Christians prayed for the emperor, the government, and the
        world. </div>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h1>6. Confession and Repentance</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Confession and repentance occurred before
        the Eucharist during the gathering. The purpose was to ensure
        participants approached the Eucharist with a pure heart, in alignment
        with Jesus' teachings on reconciliation This placement emphasized the
        need for spiritual and communal preparation before offering or receiving
        the sacred elements (<em>Didache 14:1; Hermas, Vision II</em>)​<span class=""

          data-state="closed"><span class="relative inline-flex items-center"></span></span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Members of the congregation confessed
        their sins. This included individuals who had committed minor sins and
        those guilty of more serious offenses. Confession was both a personal
        and communal act, reflecting the gravity of sin and the need for
        reconciliation (<em>Shepherd of Hermas, Vision II, 6.4; O'Donnell, 1908,
          Penance in the Early Church</em>).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The act involved acknowledging
        transgressions to reconcile with God and the community. The <em>Didache</em>
        (14:1) instructs believers to "confess your transgressions, so that your
        sacrifice may be pure." While minor sins were addressed individually or
        through prayer, grave sins required public acknowledgment and acts of
        repentance (<em>Penance in the Early Church, p. 46; The Ministry in the
          Primitive Church, Knox</em>) ​</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Minor Sins:</b>&nbsp; Minor sins, such
        as idle talk, envy, or negligence in duties, were confessed privately or
        during moments of silent prayer, often guided by personal reflection.
        These sins did not sever one’s relationship with God but required
        repentance for spiritual growth<em></em> (<em>Didache</em>, 14:1, c. 100
        AD).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Grave Sins:</b> Grave sins, including
        apostasy, murder, and adultery, were considered severe transgressions
        that disrupted both the individual’s relationship with God and the unity
        of the community. They required public confession and acts of penance to
        demonstrate genuine repentance. Acts such as wearing sackcloth, fasting,
        or making public gestures of humility were common practices. Tertullian
        described this in <em>On Purity</em>: “In the church, a sinner is
        encouraged to publicly acknowledge their sin, that they might be
        reconciled to God” (Tertullian, <em>On Purity</em>, c. 200 AD).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mediation by Leaders:</b> A bishop or
        presbyter played a central role in guiding the penitent through the
        reconciliation process. This involved ensuring the sincerity of
        repentance and mediating between the individual and the congregation. As
        noted in <em>Penance in the Early Church</em>, these leaders bore the
        responsibility of determining appropriate penances and facilitating the
        restoration of the sinner to the community (O'Donnell, <em>Penance in
          the Early Church</em>, 1908, p. 54).</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h1>7. The Eucharist (Lord’s Supper)</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The Eucharist took place after the
        prayers, following the sequence of scripture readings, sermon, and
        intercessions [Justin Martyr, First Apology 67].</p>
      <p><b>Preparation of the elements</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Members of the community brought bread and
        wine (sometimes mixed with water) to the gathering. These elements were
        placed on a table or altar in the meeting space [Justin Martyr, <em>First
          Apology</em> 65; <em>Didache</em> 9:1–3].</p>
      <p><b>Dismissal of the Catechumens</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Before the Eucharist began, unbaptized
        individuals (catechumens) were dismissed. Only baptized members of the
        community were permitted to participate in this sacred meal [Justin
        Martyr, First Apology 65; Hippolytus, Apostolic Tradition 21].</p>
      <p><b>Prayers of Thanksgiving (Eucharistic Prayer)</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The bishop or presider stood before the
        congregation and offered a prayer of thanksgiving (Greek: eucharistia)
        [Justin Martyr, First Apology 65–67; Didache 9:2–4; Hippolytus,
        Apostolic Tradition 4]. This prayer included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thanksgiving for creation and God’s gifts.</li>
        <li>Remembrance of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection.</li>
        <li>Invocation of the Holy Spirit to sanctify the bread and wine, making
          them the body and blood of Christ.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Consecration of the Elements</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The bishop or presider consecrated the
        bread and wine by speaking the words of institution: "This is my body...
        This is my blood..." (1 Corinthians 11:23–26). This act was understood
        to transform the elements into the body and blood of Christ [Justin
        Martyr, First Apology 66; Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Smyrnaeans
        7].</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Distribution of the Elements</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The consecrated bread and wine were
        distributed to the congregation. Deacons or other assistants often
        helped with this process, ensuring that all baptized members received
        the elements [Justin Martyr, First Apology 65; Hippolytus, Apostolic
        Tradition 21]. The congregation received the bread and wine as a sacred
        meal, participating in the body and blood of Christ [1 Corinthians
        10:16–17].</p>
      <p><b>Communal Participation</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">They acknowledged their transgressions
        before participating in the Eucharist (*Didache* 14:1).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The congregation partook of the bread and
        wine together, expressing their unity as the body of Christ. This act
        symbolized their shared faith and mutual love [1 Corinthians 10:17;
        Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Epistle to the Ephesians</em> 13:1].</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Closing Prayer</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">After the distribution, the bishop or
        presider offered a final prayer, often asking for God’s blessing on the
        community and their mission in the world [Justin Martyr, First Apology
        67; Didache 10:5].<b><br>
        </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Collection for the Needy</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Following the Eucharist, a collection was
        taken for the poor, widows, orphans, and others in need. This practice
        reflected the early Church’s commitment to charity and social justice
        [Justin Martyr, First Apology 67; Didache 13:4–7].</p>
      <br>
      <h1>8. Collection of Offerings for the Needy</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> <span style="color: #050605;">The
          collection occurred after the Eucharistic celebration (<em>1
            Corinthians 16:1-2; Acts 20:7</em>).</span> <span style="color: #050605;">All
          members of the congregation, particularly those "who prosper and are
          willing," contributed to the collection (<em>Justin Martyr, First
            Apology</em>, c. 160 AD).&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #050605;"></span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #050605;">Contributions
          were used to support orphans, widows, the sick, prisoners, and
          travelers. These funds provided food, shelter, and other necessities,
          embodying Christian charity (<em>Justin Martyr, First Apology</em>,
          ch. 67).<br>
        </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #050605;"></span> <span

          style="color: #050605;"> Donations were voluntary and proportional to
          each person's ability, with no compulsion to give (<em>Tertullian,
            Apology</em>, c. 200 AD).</span><span style="color: #050605;"><br>
        </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #050605;">Offerings
          were deposited with the "president" (bishop or presbyter) who oversaw
          their distribution (<em>Justin Martyr, First Apology</em>, ch. 67).
          Funds were collected and entrusted to the presiding leader (bishop),
          who distributed them according to need. This included aiding widows,
          orphans, prisoners, and travelers (<em>Justin Martyr, First Apology</em>,
          ch. 67).</span></p>
      <h1>9. Hymns and Dismissal</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #070807;">The
          congregation participated in hymns as a communal act of worship,
          singing songs often derived from scriptural themes and focused on
          Christ’s resurrection. These hymns fostered unity, joy, and a shared
          sense of purpose among the believers (<em>Justin Martyr, First Apology</em>
          1.67).</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #070807;">Following
          the hymns, the presiding leader, typically a bishop or elder,
          delivered a final prayer or blessing to conclude the assembly. This
          prayer expressed gratitude to God, invoked divine favor, and prepared
          the congregation to transition from communal worship to daily life (<em>The
            Lord’s Day: Precedents and Practice</em>).</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #070807;">The
          benediction emphasized peace, strength, and continued spiritual
          growth, sending the congregation forth with God’s blessings.
          Positioned at the conclusion of the Lord’s Day assembly, this practice
          marked the formal end of worship and noted the importance of
          integrating faith into everyday living (<em>Justin Martyr, First
            Apology</em> 1.67; <em>The Lord’s Day: Precedents and Practice</em>).</span></p>
