        <h2>First Century</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A majority of scholars conclude that
          infant baptism was not widely practiced in the 1st century due to the
          absence of clear, explicit evidence (Ferguson, 2009; Wright, 2007;
          Cross &amp; Livingstone, 2005; Grenz, 2000, p. 528). Infant baptism is
          certainly provable only from the third century and that its earliest
          literary traces belong to the outgoings of the second century, cannot
          be contested from the sources (Jeremias, 2004, p.30). Jeremias quotes
          forty ancient documents as sources, of which twenty five are
          designated as explicit references to infant baptism – the earliest
          dating from 200 A.D (Stander, H., &amp; Louw, 2004, p.17).
          First-century Christians believed that small children, especially
          infants, were inherently sinless, so conversion was achieved by
          personally persuading children rather than through a formal baptismal
          rite for infants (Keeran, 2009, p. 11). This view is supported by
          early texts; for example, the Didache (c. 80 AD) favors adult baptism,
          implying that its author held that children were born sinless, and the
          Epistle of Barnabas (c. 70 AD) similarly assumes infant sinlessness
          (Wiley, 2002, pp. 38–39). Thus, Christianity at this stage, had no
          specific doctrine of original sin (Obach, 2008, p. 41).</p>
        <h2>Second Century</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Begin with an audit of your digital life. Which apps do you actually
          use? Which subscriptions provide real value? Which notifications
          deserve to interrupt your day? Be ruthless in eliminating the
          unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Next, establish boundaries. Consider implementing tech-free times or
          zones in your life. Perhaps your bedroom becomes a phone-free
          sanctuary, or the first hour of your morning is reserved for
          non-digital activities. These boundaries help break the cycle of
          compulsive checking and scrolling.</p>
        <p>Finally, optimize what remains. Customize your digital tools to serve
          your needs rather than the other way around. This might mean turning
          off autoplay features, using browser extensions that block distracting
          elements, or setting up automation to reduce digital busywork.</p>
        <h2>The Paradox of Choice in Software Design</h2>
        <p>For those of us who build technology, there's a valuable lesson here.
          The impulse to add features—to solve every edge case and accommodate
          every user preference—often results in bloated, confusing products
          that serve no one particularly well.</p>
        <p>The most beloved and enduring tech products often excel not because
          they do everything, but because they do a few things exceptionally
          well. They embody a clear vision and maintain a focused purpose. They
          understand that simplicity is not the absence of capability, but the
          presence of elegance.</p>
        <h2>The Future Is Less</h2>
        <p>As we move forward into an increasingly digital future, perhaps our
          greatest challenge will not be creating more technology, but creating
          better technology—tools that respect our attention, simplify rather
          than complicate, and enhance our humanity rather than diminish it.</p>
        <p>The next revolution in tech may not be about what new capabilities we
          can add, but what distractions we can eliminate. In a world of endless
          options and infinite content, the ability to focus might become our
          most precious resource.</p>
        <p>Digital minimalism offers a path forward—not by rejecting the amazing
          tools we've created, but by putting them in their proper place. By
          choosing less, we might actually gain more: more focus, more peace,
          and more meaningful connection in both our digital and physical lives.</p>
