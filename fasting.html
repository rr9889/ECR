      <h1>Fasting in Early Christianity</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Fasting was central to early Christian life as a discipline of repentance, spiritual preparation, and humility. This guide outlines its biblical and historical foundations, drawing on pre-325 AD sources and the writings of the Church Fathers.
      </p>

      <h2>Biblical Principles of Fasting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Jesus fasted for 40 days (Matthew 4:2), demonstrating its importance in spiritual preparation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Believers are instructed on fasting in Matthew 6:16–18, emphasizing sincerity over outward show.
        </li>
        <li>
          The early Church practiced fasting during decision-making, as seen in Acts 13:2: <br>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              "While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'"
              - Acts 13:2
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Teachings of the Church Fathers</h2>

      <h3>Tertullian (c. 160–240 AD)</h3>
      <p>
        Tertullian viewed fasting as a vital spiritual discipline:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Fasting is the strength of our soul, the safeguard of our faith, the armament of our defense. It repels temptations, humbles the soul, and fortifies the spirit."
          - <em>On Fasting</em>, Chapter 1
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Origen (c. 184–253 AD)</h3>
      <p>
        Origen emphasized fasting as a companion to prayer for spiritual growth:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "When a man fasts with the right intent, his soul ascends to God. Fasting and prayer are wings that lift the spirit."
          - <em>Homilies on Leviticus</em>, Homily 10
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>The Didache</h3>
      <p>
        The <em>Didache</em>, an early Christian manual, prescribed specific fasting days to distinguish Christians from others:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Let not your fasts be with the hypocrites, for they fast on Mondays and Thursdays, but do you fast on Wednesdays and Fridays. 2. And do not pray as the hypocrites, but as the Lord commanded in his Gospel,."
          - <em>Didache</em>, Chapter 8
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Practical Guidance for Fasting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fasting typically involved abstaining from food and drink until evening or for several days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Partial fasting, such as avoiding meat or wine, was common.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fasting should be accompanied by prayer and acts of charity, reflecting repentance and devotion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Fasting in the early Church was a deeply rooted practice, drawn from scripture and upheld by influential leaders. By following these biblical and historical principles, modern Christians can engage in fasting as a meaningful spiritual discipline.
