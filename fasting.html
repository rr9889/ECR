        Outcomes of Fasting</h2>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h3>Fasting for Spiritual Strength and Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Jesus fasted for 40 days in the wilderness, overcoming the devil’s
            temptations and preparing for His ministry (Matthew 4:1-11).</li>
          <li>Jesus taught that some spiritual challenges, like casting out
            demons, require prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting as an Act of Longing for God</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Jesus said His disciples would fast after His departure, showing
            fasting as an act of longing for His presence (Matthew 9:14-15).</li>
          <li>The prophetess Anna fasted and prayed continually, worshiping God
            and waiting for the Messiah (Luke 2:36-37).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting for Guidance and Decision-Making</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The church in Antioch fasted and prayed before sending Barnabas
            and Saul for missionary work, seeking God’s guidance (Acts 13:2-3).</li>
          <li>Paul and Barnabas fasted and prayed when appointing elders,
            showing fasting’s role in seeking wisdom for leadership (Acts
            14:23).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting with the Right Heart</h3>
        <ul>

            should be done in secret to honor God (Matthew 6:16-18).</li>
          <li>The Pharisee boasted about fasting, but his pride made it
            meaningless. Fasting must be done with humility (Luke 18:9-14).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting as a Test of Perseverance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Paul fasted as part of his dedication to the gospel, enduring both
            voluntary and involuntary deprivation, teaching endurance and
            reliance on God (2 Corinthians 6:5, 11:27).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting for Deliverance and Protection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Esther and the Jews fasted for three days, and God delivered them
            from Haman’s plot (Esther 4:16, 7:10).</li>

            journey to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:21-23).</li>

        <h3>Fasting for Repentance and Renewal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The people of Nineveh fasted and repented, and God spared the city
            from destruction (Jonah 3:5-10).</li>
          <li>David fasted and prayed after his sin with Bathsheba, and God
            forgave him (Psalm 51:1-17).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fasting for Spiritual Breakthrough</h3>
        <ul>

            understanding of future events (Daniel 10:2-3, 12-13).</li>

      <ul>

          and wine.</li>
