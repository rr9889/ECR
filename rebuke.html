    <h1>Rebuking GotQuestions Using Their Own Words</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>1. Cultural Relativism Contradiction</h4>
    <p class="source">Taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/head-coverings.html">Should
        Christian women wear head coverings?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Paul affirms the rightness of following that cultural mandate—to
        dispense with the head coverings on women would send the entirely wrong
        signal to the culture at large."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Response to the statement taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/cultural-relativism.html">What
        is Cultural Relativism?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Cultural relativism sees nothing inherently wrong (and nothing
        inherently good) with any cultural expression. So, the ancient Mayan
        practices of self-mutilation and human sacrifice are neither good nor
        bad; they are simply cultural distinctives."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>2. Worldliness vs. Submission</h4>
    <p class="source">Taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/head-coverings.html">Should
        Christian women wear head coverings?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"In today’s culture, we no longer view a woman’s wearing of a head
        covering as a sign of submission."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Response to the statement taken from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/not-of-this-world.html">What
          does it mean that Christians are not of this world?</a>
        <blockquote> "Christians, as part of Jesus' kingdom, are not of this
          world." </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/do-not-conform-to-this-world.html">What
          does it mean to not conform to the pattern of this world?</a>
        <blockquote> "As followers of Christ, we are not to be conformed to this
          world's pattern." </blockquote>

    </ul>

    <h4>3. Authority of Scripture Undermined</h4>
    <p class="source">Taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/head-coverings.html">Should
        Christian women wear head coverings?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"God is far more concerned with an attitude of submission than an
        outward display of submission via a head covering."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Response to the statement taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/dress-modestly.html">What

        understanding of ourselves, and respect for the people we are around."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>4. Symbolism and Modesty</h4>
    <p class="source">Taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/head-coverings.html">Should
        Christian women wear head coverings?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The veil or covering on the head of a believing Corinthian wife showed
        that she was under the authority of her husband, and therefore under
        submission to God."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Response to the statement taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/dress-modestly.html">What
        Does it Mean to Dress Modestly?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"At the core of dressing modestly is reverence for God. Our outward
        appearance does communicate things to the watching world."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>5. Biblical Influence</h4>
    <p class="source">Taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/head-coverings.html">Should
        Christian women wear head coverings?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"Scarves and hats are fashion accessories. A woman has the choice to
        wear a head covering if she views it as a sign of her submission."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Response to the statement taken from: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-influence.html">How
        Much Influence is the Bible Supposed to Have on Society?</a></p>

        Bible, life simply doesn’t work as well."</p>

        Christian women wear head coverings?</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"The apostle Paul is addressing an issue related to the Corinthian
        culture that was being allowed to disrupt the church."</p>

        Corinthians 1:2</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ
