          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Infant baptism has been a topic of theological debate and
            historical study within Christianity. This article explores its
            origins, development, and theological significance in early
            Christian practice.</p>

        <section id="1st-century">
          <h2>1st Century Context</h2>
          <p>There is little evidence of infant baptism in the 1st century.
            Biblical references to household baptisms, such as in Acts 16:33,
            are sometimes interpreted to include children, but explicit mention
            of infants is absent. Scholars agree that infant baptism likely
            became widespread in the 2nd or 3rd century.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Acts 2:38-39</strong>: "Repent, and be baptized each of
              you on the Name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins, and you
              will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, for the promise is to
              you and to your children."</p>

          <h2>Emergence of Infant Baptism</h2>
          <p>By the 2nd century, infant baptism became more common, motivated by
            theological concerns such as original sin and high infant mortality
            rates. Emergency baptisms for gravely ill children reflected the
            pastoral care of the early Christian community.</p>

        <section id="theology">
          <h2>Theological Justifications</h2>
          <p>Church Fathers such as Origen and Cyprian defended infant baptism,
            emphasizing its apostolic roots and its necessity for the remission
            of original sin. They likened baptism to circumcision in the Old
            Covenant, a sign extended to infants.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Origen: "The Church received from the apostles the tradition of
              giving baptism even to infants." (<em>Commentary on Romans</em>,
              Book V, 9)</p>
          </blockquote>

        <section id="evidence">
          <h2>Historical and Archaeological Evidence</h2>
          <p>Evidence from catacomb inscriptions and small baptismal fonts, such
            as those in Dura-Europos, supports the practice by the 3rd century.
            These findings indicate the inclusion of infants in the Christian
            community.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="dissent">
          <h2>Dissenting Views</h2>
          <p>Tertullian advised delaying baptism for infants, citing concerns
            about post-baptismal sin and the need for personal commitment. His
            views, however, were a minority position within the early Church.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Why rush to baptize them if baptism itself is not an urgent
              necessity? Let them become Christians when they are capable of
              knowing Christ for themselves." (<em>On Baptism</em>, Chapter 18)</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>While 1st-century evidence for infant baptism is scarce, the
            practice became well-established by the 2nd and 3rd centuries.
            Supported by theological arguments and historical evidence, it was
            viewed as essential for the salvation and inclusion of infants in
            the Christian community.</p>
