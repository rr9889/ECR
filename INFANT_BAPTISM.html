        <h1 id="biblical-basis">The Issue</h1>
        <p data-start="0" data-end="521">Did you know some believe unbaptized
          babies are denied heaven—sent to hell, placed in Limbo (a widely
          accepted but unofficial Catholic idea), or deprived of grace for not
          being baptized in time? Or that baptism removes original sin from Adam
          and Eve? While once widely accepted, these views lack strong biblical
          support. The Bible emphasizes God’s justice and mercy, not infant
          condemnation (Matthew 19:14). So why the rush? God’s grace surpasses
          human rules. Strict biblical analysis shows baptism is consistently
          linked to personal faith, repentance, and belief, which infants cannot
          express. While it may mark Church inclusion, no clear biblical mandate
          requires infant baptism for salvation, forgiveness, or receiving the
          Holy Spirit.</p>

        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
          <p><span style="color: #343434;">A majority of scholars conclude that
              infant baptism was not widely practiced in the 1st century due to
              the absence of clear, explicit evidence </span><span style="color: #343434;">(Ferguson,
              2009; Wright, 2007; Cross &amp; Livingstone, 2005; Grenz, 2000, p.
              528). First-century Christians believed that small children,
              especially infants, were inherently sinless, so conversion was
              achieved by personally persuading children rather than through a
              formal baptismal rite for infants (Keeran, 2009, p. 11).
              Christianity at this stage, had no specific doctrine of original
              sin (Obach, 2008, p. 41).</span><br>

              style="color: #343434;"><br>
            </span></p>
          <div>Household baptisms in Acts and 1 Corinthians don’t clearly
            include infants, as Ferguson (2009, p. 178) argues, calling infant
            baptism an “argument from silence.” Examples suggest conscious
            faith: Cornelius’ household “heard the word” and spoke in
            tongues (Acts 10:44, 46); Lydia’s, a wealthy businesswoman’s,
            likely had servants and family, with no children noted (Acts 16:14);
            the Philippian jailer’s household “rejoiced, having believed” (Acts
            16:34); Crispus’ household believed and was baptized (Acts 18:8);
            and Stephanas’ household actively served the church, “devoted to the
            saints” (1 Cor. 16:15).</div>

            <h1 id="biblical-basis">Second Century</h1>
            <div>
              <div>Early 2nd-century apologists like Aristides (c. 125 AD, <em>Apology</em>
                15) and Athenagoras (c. 177 AD, <em>On the Resurrection</em>)
                suggest infants are sinless, with Aristides noting they die
                “sinless” and Athenagoras implying they’re not judged, having
                done “neither evil nor good” (Ferguson, 1999b, pp. 53-54).
                Justin Martyr (c. 153-155 AD, <em>Second Apology</em> 10; <em>First
                  Apology</em> 15) adds that children are morally neutral until
                rational choice, praising their purity without innate sin
                (Wiley, 2002). However, no text confirms conversion by
                persuasion over baptism. Clement of Rome and Ignatius assume
                universal sin (Wiley, 2002, pp. 38–39), while Clement of
                Alexandria hints at inherited sin (<em>The Instructor</em>).
                Scholars (Ferguson, 2009; Wall, 1703) see 2nd-century infant
                baptism as rare, often emergency-driven due to high mortality
                (30%) (Osiek &amp; MacDonald, 2006), with Wright and Aland
                noting traces by 200 AD (Wright, 2007; Aland, 2005). Epitaphs
                vary—some suggest emergency baptisms, others don’t (Ferguson,
                1999, p. 162; Keeran, 2009, p. 11). Irenaeus (c. 174 AD, <em>Against
                  Heresies</em> II, 22.4) uses symbolic language of Christ
                sanctifying all ages, not mandating infant baptism, per Jenson
                (2012) and Meyers (1988), though Bakke (2005) and Nelson (1996)
                see it as baptismal if “reborn” is technical. Tertullian (c. 198
                AD, <em>On Baptism</em> 18) opposes it, favoring delay for
                children. As Christianity grew, catechesis formalized baptism,
                reducing infant rites without preparation (Bakke, 2005).</div>

            <h1><span style="color: #020202;">Third Century<br>
              </span></h1>
            <div>Infant baptism evidence emerges in the 3rd century (Aland,
              2004, p. 10), though many parents delayed it until the 5th century
              for spiritual benefits, emergencies, or their own unbaptized
              status (Messmer, 2022, pp. 61-89; Jensen, 2012, p. 371).
              Tertullian, in <em>On Baptism</em> (c. 198 AD), opposed it
              despite its established use, favoring delay for personal faith
              (Ferguson, 1999, p. 58), a view out of step with North African
              practice where it thrived and possibly began (Strange, 1996, p.
              123; Yılmaz, 2020, p. 375). Hippolytus (<em>Apostolic Tradition</em>
              21.3-5) supported it, allowing parental proxy for young children
              (Ferguson, 1999, p. 58). Origen called it apostolic, its basis
              unclear (Ferguson, 1999, p. 58), while Cyprian urged immediate
              baptism for newborns, citing equal grace (Jensen, 2012, p. 371). A
              Rome inscription shows emergency baptisms occurred (Jensen, 2012,
              p. 371), though Aland (2004, p. 10) sees no new insight beyond
              texts.</div>
