        <p data-start="0" data-end="521">History indeed repeats itself, with new
          actors replacing the old. Tyrannical religious leaders—once the
          Pharisees, now the Magisterium. The gatekeepers of knowledge—once
          insisting on Hebrew, now demanding Latin. What has truly changed? This
          article examines the historical and scriptural falsehoods propagated
          by the so-called Apostolic Churches.</p>

        <h1>Apostolic Succession</h1>
        <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
          <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">According to Catholic teaching, Apostolic
            Succession refers to an unbroken lineage of bishops tracing back to
            the Apostles, with authority passed down through ordination.
            However, Scripture affirms that Christ alone is the foundation of
            the Church (1 Corinthians 3:11) and that the Apostles and prophets,
            with Christ as the cornerstone, form the foundation of the faith
            (Ephesians 2:20). In a biblical sense, true Apostolic Succession is
            not about an unbroken chain of human leadership but about faithfully
            preserving and passing on the teachings of the Apostles, adhering
            strictly to the Word of God as recorded in Scripture (2 Timothy
            3:16-17, Galatians 1:8-9).</p>
          <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Jesus says to Peter, 'I will give you the
            keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall
            be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed
            in heaven.' Catholics cite this verse to establish Peter as the
            chief apostle. However, early Christians did not interpret it as
            granting him supreme authority or exclusive succession.<span class="BxUVEf ILfuVd"

            <div>
              <div>No Apostle is recorded as a bishop or pope in Scripture. They
                remained Apostles until their death and appointed a plurality of
                elders (presbyters/bishops) to oversee the churches they
                planted. Early sources, including <em data-start="292" data-end="303">1
                  Clement</em> (c. 96 AD), indicate that the Church in Rome was
                initially governed by a group of presbyters rather than a single
                bishop. Irenaeus (<em data-start="436" data-end="454">Against
                  Heresies</em> 3.3.3), Eusebius (<em data-start="473" data-end="497">Ecclesiastical
                  History</em> 3.2.1, 3.4), and Clement of Rome confirm that
                Linus was the first recognized bishop of Rome. However, the
                transition to a single monarchical bishop in Rome appears to
                have developed over time, solidifying by the 3rd century.</div>

            <div>
              <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Scripture does not assign special
                authority to Rome. The concept of the Roman bishop’s universal
                authority was established in the 4th and 5th centuries, with
                Pope Leo I (440–461 AD) formally asserting papal primacy. </p>
              <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Nowhere in the Bible does Jesus or the
                apostles establish a singular geographic center for Christianity
                (John 4:21-23, Matthew 28:19-20).&nbsp; Jesus emphasized a
                spiritual kingdom, not a physical headquarters (Luke 17:20-21,
                John 18:36). Authority in the early church was based on
                apostolic teaching and the presence of Christ, not a fixed city
                (Ephesians 2:19-20, Matthew 18:20). Christian leadership spread
                across multiple cities (Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, Rome,
                Corinth, etc.), with no one city holding exclusive rule (Acts
                1:8, Acts 15:22-29, Romans 1:7)."</p>

            <h1> Canonization of the Bible</h1>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The Old Testament was already recognized
              before church councils or institutions arisen. The Hebrew
              Scriptures (Old Testament) were established and used by the Jewish
              people long before Christianity. The Jews were entrusted with
              preserving the Torah and the prophetic writings (Romans 3:2).
              During Jesus’ time, these Scriptures were used as evidence to
              confirm His identity as the Messiah (Luke 24:27, John 5:39).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>From the 1st to 3rd centuries, churches circulated and recognized
              various writings, including the Gospels, Paul’s letters, and other
              apostolic works. Irenaeus (c. 180 AD) and Origen (c. 250 AD)
              referenced a core collection of New Testament writings before any
              official Catholic canon. The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170 AD) lists
              many New Testament books already in use. The Councils of Hippo
              (393 AD) and Carthage (397 AD, 419 AD) did not "invent" the Bible
              but rather recognized what was already widely accepted among
              Christians.</p>
            <h1>The Perpetual Virginity of Mary</h1>

            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Do sinful people need a Savior? If the
              answer is yes, Mary rejoices in God as her personal Savior (Luke
              1:46-47). She lived in a fallen world where no one is exempt from
              sin (Romans 3:23, 5:12, 3:10). </p>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The claim that Mary was conceived without
              original sin was formally declared as dogma in 1854. It is
              justified by Mary being 'full of grace' (<em data-start="483" data-end="494">Luke
                1:28</em>) According to Acts 6:8, Stephan was full of grace.
              Does this mean Stephen was sinless? No. This logic is not
              consistent, God is consistent.</p>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Grace = unmerited favor, kindness, and
              gift of salvation. Why would Mary need salvation if she was

            <h1>Structure of the Church</h1>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The modern Catholic Church is centralized,
              with authority flowing from the Pope as Christ’s vicar on earth
              (CCC 882), holding supreme jurisdiction over the Church. It
              follows a hierarchical-episcopal model, where bishops, as
              successors of the apostles, oversee dioceses and maintain unity
              through apostolic succession (CCC 1555-1560). Governance is
              universal, with local churches under the authority of the
              Magisterium and Vatican, ensuring doctrinal consistency (CCC
              85-86). Worship is liturgical and sacramental, centered on the
              Eucharist as the “source and summit” of Christian life (CCC 1324),
              with ordained clergy leading (CCC 1348). Deacons serve under
              bishops and priests, assisting in ministry (CCC 1570). This
              hierarchical model prioritizes unity, apostolic tradition, and
              centralized teaching authority, with doctrine safeguarded by the
              Church’s Magisterium (CCC 888-892).</p>
            <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">The 1st-century church was decentralized,
              with each local congregation under Christ’s headship (Colossians
              1:18). It followed a plurality-elder model, where multiple
              presbyteroi (elders) provided spiritual oversight (Acts 14:23,
              Titus 1:5), also called overseers (bishops) (1 Timothy 3:1).
              Governance was congregational, with churches operating
              autonomously while grounded in apostolic authority (Ephesians
              2:20). Worship was participatory, with members contributing hymns,
              teachings, and revelations (1 Corinthians 14:26). Deacons
              (diakonoi) assisted in practical service (Acts 6:3), supporting
              the elders. This servant-leadership model emphasized local
              autonomy, shared responsibility, and community-based
              decision-making.</p>
