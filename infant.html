      <p><span style="color: #343434;">Early Christian worship was far from
          uniform. Rather than a single “apostolic” tradition, liturgical
          practices before the 325 AD varied significantly by culture, language,
          and theological outlook. Worship in the first three centuries
          encompassed diverse rites, such as initiation, across Armenian,
          Syrian, Greek, Coptic, and Latin communities (Johnson, 2018).</span></p>
      <p><span style="color: #343434;"><b>Conclusion:</b> There is no Apostolic,
          Historical or Biblical tradition prescribed to infants getting
          baptized.</span></p>

            style="color: #343434;">A majority of scholars conclude that infant
            baptism was not widely practiced in the 1st century due to the
            absence of clear, explicit evidence (Ferguson, 2009; Jeremias, 1960;
            Wright, 2007; Cross &amp; Livingstone, 2005; Grenz, 2000, p. 528).</span></div>

            style="color: #343434;">First-century Christians believed that small
            children, especially infants, were inherently sinless, so conversion
            was achieved by personally persuading children rather than through a
            formal baptismal rite for infants (Keeran, 2009, p. 11). This view
            is supported by early texts; for example, the Didache (c. 80 AD)
            favors adult baptism, implying that its author held that children
            were born sinless, and the Epistle of Barnabas (c. 70 AD) similarly
            assumes infant sinlessness (Wiley, 2002, pp. 38–39). Thus,
            Christianity at this stage, had no specific doctrine of original sin

              none of the Synoptic accounts explicitly place this event in a
              baptismal context. Moreover, Matthew 18:3’s phrase “to become as
              children” clearly addresses mature believers rather than young
              children (Ferguson, 2009, p. 138).</span></p>

                    The biblical texts provide unclear implications regarding
                    the practice of infant baptism in the 1st century.
                    Proponents argue that passages referring to the baptism of
                    entire households—such as Acts 2:38–39; Acts 16:15, 16:33;
                    and 1 Corinthians 1:16—suggest that infants may have been
                    included. For example, Matthew 19:14 (“Allow the children,
                    and do not forbid them to come to Me…”) is sometimes cited,
                    yet none of the Synoptic accounts explicitly place this
                    event in a baptismal context. Moreover, Matthew 18:3’s
                    phrase “to become as children” clearly addresses mature

              baptisms are described in Acts and 1 Corinthians, Ferguson (2009,
              p. 178) contends that such descriptions are “hardly applicable to
              small children” and that inferring infant baptism from these texts
              is an “argument from silence.” Additionally, the promise in Acts
              2:38–39, which states that the gift of the Holy Spirit is given
              “to you and to your children, and to all those afar off,” likely
              refers to future generations or Gentiles, not exclusively to
              infants.</span></p>

            Clement of Rome’s “1 Clement” and the letters of Ignatius of Antioch
            (Letter to the Smyrnaeans), which assume universal sin without
            discussing its origin. In contrast, Clement of Alexandria’s works,
            such as “The Instructor” hint at the idea that sin is inherited from
            Adam, though without much elaboration (Wiley, 2002, pp. 38–39).</span></div>

            style="color: #343434;">Historical studies (Ferguson, 2009; Wall,
            2003) show that ambiguous 2nd-century evidence, often seen as
            emergency baptisms, does not indicate a universal practice of infant
            baptism. Instead, factors such as community expansion, family
            inclusion, and high infant mortality led to its eventual
            normalization. Ferguson (2009) argues that infant baptism likely
            began as an emergency measure for critically ill children, while
            Osiek and MacDonald (2006) highlight that risks during childbirth
            and a 30% infant mortality rate drove parents to secure their
            children’s spiritual safety, as reflected in Cyprian’s advocacy for
            prompt baptism.</span></div>

            style="color: #343434;">Some early Christian burial epitaphs suggest
            that, in cases of severe illness when parents feared their child
            might die, baptism was sometimes administered (Ferguson,
            Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, 162). In contrast, other
            epitaphs make no mention of infant baptism (Keeran, 2009, p.11).</span></div>

        <span style="color: #343434;"> Regarding Irenaeus of Lyons’ statement to
          "[baptize] infants, children, youths, and old men" (Against Heresies,
          Book II, 22.4), dated around 174 AD, a careful reading of the full
          context reveals that his language is symbolic. Irenaeus uses the
          imagery of Christ “becoming an infant for infants” to illustrate that
          Christ sanctifies every stage of life. Rather than issuing a direct,
          doctrinal command that infants must be baptized, the text employs
          metaphor to show how Christ identifies with all ages.</span></div>

          style="color: #343434;">In Chapter 18 of On Baptism (written around
          198 AD), Tertullian directly addresses the doctrine of infant baptism,
          asserting that “The delay of baptism is more profitable, according to
          everyone’s condition and disposition, and even age: and especially in
          the case of little children.”</span></div>

        <p><span style="color: #343434;">Small baptismal fonts at Dura-Europos
            and epitaphs referencing baptism, has been interpreted by some
            scholars as indicative of infant baptism. Additionally, the
            depiction of small figures in baptismal scenes in catacombs, like
            those in the Catacomb of Callixtus, is argued to represent children.
            However, critics note that the diminutive scale of fonts and figures
            might reflect stylistic choices or practical constraints rather than
            a direct reference to the baptism of infants.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #343434;">In 215 AD, Hippolytus of Rome developed
            the Rome doctrine of infant baptism rituals (Keeran, 2009). Hewrote
            in the Apostolic Tradition (Chapter 21): “Baptize first the
            children, and if they can speak for themselves, let them do so.
            Otherwise, let their parents or other relatives speak for them.”</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #343434;">Origen, writing around 246 AD, stated
            in his Commentary on Romans (Book V, 9) that “the Church received
            from the apostles the tradition of giving baptism even to infants.”<br>
          </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #343434;">Augustine argued that baptism was
            essential for salvation, contending that infant baptism demonstrated
            that even infants were affected by original sin and held accountable
            for it (On Marriage and Concupiscence 2.29.51, as cited in Pelikan,
            2009, p. 292). He also noted that the exorcisms performed during
            baptism indicated that children were vulnerable to demonic influence
            (On the Merits and Remission of Sins 1.23, 28, 39; 3.2.7; 3.3.6, as
            cited in Pelikan, 2009, p. 292; Ferguson, 2009, p. 162). This
            theological emphasis helped cement the practice of infant baptism in
            the broader church.</span></p>
        <span style="color: #343434;">Infant baptism helped refine the doctrine
          of original sin, a connection first clearly articulated by Cyprian,
          who argued that invoking original sin validated a practice whose
          apostolic credentials were unquestioned (Pelikan, 2009, pp. 165, 291,
          292). Cyprian also reports that an African council ruled that newborns
          should not be barred from baptism, and by the fifth century, infant
          baptism was increasingly justified as a means of forgiving original
          sin, leading to its wider adoption (Lane, 2004, p. 117; Keeran, 2009,
          p. 12). </span></div>
