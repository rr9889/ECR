      <p><span style="color: #000000;">Early Christian worship was far from
          uniform. Rather than a single “apostolic” tradition, liturgical
          practices before the 325 AD varied significantly by culture, language,
          and theological outlook. Worship in the first three centuries
          encompassed diverse rites, such as initiation, across Armenian,
          Syrian, Greek, Coptic, and Latin communities (Johnson, 2018).</span></p>
      <p><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Conclusion:</b> There is no Apostolic,
          Historical or Biblical tradition prescribed to infants getting

            style="color: #343434;">A majority of scholars conclude that infant
            baptism was not widely practiced in the 1st century due to the
            absence of clear, explicit evidence (Ferguson, 2009; Jeremias, 1960;
            Wright, 2007; Cross &amp; Livingstone, 2005; Grenz, 2000, p. 528).</span></div>

            style="color: #343434;">First-century Christians believed that small
            children, especially infants, were inherently sinless, so conversion
            was achieved by personally persuading children rather than through a
            formal baptismal rite for infants (Keeran, 2009, p. 11). This view
            is supported by early texts; for example, the Didache (c. 80 AD)
            favors adult baptism, implying that its author held that children
            were born sinless, and the Epistle of Barnabas (c. 70 AD) similarly
            assumes infant sinlessness (Wiley, 2002, pp. 38–39). Thus,
            Christianity at this stage, had no specific doctrine of original sin
            (Obach, 2008, p. 41).<br>

              none of the Synoptic accounts explicitly place this event in a
              baptismal context. Moreover, Matthew 18:3’s phrase “to become as
              children” clearly addresses mature believers rather than young
              children (Ferguson, 2009, p. 138).</span></p>

                    The biblical texts provide unclear implications regarding
                    the practice of infant baptism in the 1st century.
                    Proponents argue that passages referring to the baptism of
                    entire households—such as Acts 2:38–39; Acts 16:15, 16:33;
                    and 1 Corinthians 1:16—suggest that infants may have been
                    included. For example, Matthew 19:14 (“Allow the children,
                    and do not forbid them to come to Me…”) is sometimes cited,
                    yet none of the Synoptic accounts explicitly place this
                    event in a baptismal context. Moreover, Matthew 18:3’s
                    phrase “to become as children” clearly addresses mature
                    believers rather than young children (Ferguson, 2009, p. 13</span></span></sup>Household
              baptisms are described in Acts and 1 Corinthians, Ferguson (2009,
              p. 178) contends that such descriptions are “hardly applicable to
              small children” and that inferring infant baptism from these texts
              is an “argument from silence.” Additionally, the promise in Acts
              2:38–39, which states that the gift of the Holy Spirit is given
              “to you and to your children, and to all those afar off,” likely
              refers to future generations or Gentiles, not exclusively to
              infants.</span></p>
          <h1 id="icon"><span style="color: #343434;">2nd Century</span></h1>
          <p>In the early second century (125 AD), apologists such as Aristides
            (<em>Apology</em>, Chapter 15) said that children are born sinless
            and are converted through personal persuasion rather than through a
            formal baptismal rite. Aristides states, “And when a child is born
            to one of them, the Christians give thanks to God; and if the child
            dies in infancy, they give thanks even more, for it has passed from
            this life sinless.” (<span style="color: #343434;">Ferguson, 1999b,
            </span>pp. 53-54)</p>
          <p>In c. 177 AD, the apologist Athenagoras, in his work <em data-start="50"
              data-end="83">On the Resurrection of the Dead</em>, wrote: “Yet
            not all who rise again are to be judged: for if only a just judgment
            were the cause of the resurrection, it would of course follow that
            those who had done neither evil nor good — namely, very young
            children — would not rise again; but seeing that all are to rise
            again, those who have died in infancy as well as others” </p>
          <p> <span style="color: #343434;">Clement of Rome’s “1 Clement” and
              the letters of Ignatius of Antioch (Letter to the Smyrnaeans),
              which assume universal sin without discussing its origin. In
              contrast, Clement of Alexandria’s works, such as “The Instructor”
              hint at the idea that sin is inherited from Adam, though without
              much elaboration (Wiley, 2002, pp. 38–39).</span><span style="color: #343434;"><br>
            </span></p>
          <p><span style="color: #343434;">Historical studies (Ferguson, 2009;
              Wall, 2003) show that ambiguous 2nd-century evidence, often seen
              as emergency baptisms, does not indicate a universal practice of
              infant baptism. Instead, factors such as community expansion,
              family inclusion, and high infant mortality led to its eventual
              normalization. Ferguson (2009) argues that infant baptism likely
              began as an emergency measure for critically ill children, while
              Osiek and MacDonald (2006) highlight that risks during childbirth
              and a 30% infant mortality rate drove parents to secure their
              children’s spiritual safety, as reflected in Cyprian’s advocacy
              for prompt baptism.</span><span style="color: #343434;"></span><span

          <p><span style="color: #343434;">Some early Christian burial epitaphs
              suggest that, in cases of severe illness when parents feared their
              child might die, baptism was sometimes administered (Ferguson,
              1999, p. 162). In contrast, other epitaphs make no mention of
              infant baptism (Keeran, 2009, p.11).</span><span style="color: #343434;"></span><span

          <p><span style="color: #343434;">Regarding Irenaeus of Lyons’
              statement to "[baptize] infants, children, youths, and old men"
              (Against Heresies, Book II, 22.4), dated around 174 AD, a careful
              reading of the full context reveals that his language is symbolic.
              Irenaeus uses the imagery of Christ “becoming an infant for
              infants” to illustrate that Christ sanctifies every stage of life.
              Rather than issuing a direct, doctrinal command that infants must
              be baptized, the text employs metaphor to show how Christ
              identifies with all ages.</span><span style="color: #343434;"><br>
            </span></p>
          <p><span style="color: #343434;">In Chapter 18 of On Baptism (written
              around 198 AD), Tertullian directly addresses the doctrine of
              infant baptism, asserting that “The delay of baptism is more
              profitable, according to everyone’s condition and disposition, and
              even age: and especially in the case of little children.”</span> </p>

        <p><span style="color: #343434;">Small baptismal fonts at Dura-Europos
            and epitaphs referencing baptism, has been interpreted by some
            scholars as indicative of infant baptism. Additionally, the
            depiction of small figures in baptismal scenes in catacombs, like
            those in the Catacomb of Callixtus, is argued to represent children.
            However, critics note that the diminutive scale of fonts and figures
            might reflect stylistic choices or practical constraints rather than
            a direct reference to the baptism of infants.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #343434;">In 215 AD, Hippolytus of Rome developed
            the Rome doctrine of infant baptism rituals (Keeran, 2009). Hewrote
            in the Apostolic Tradition (Chapter 21): “Baptize first the
            children, and if they can speak for themselves, let them do so.
            Otherwise, let their parents or other relatives speak for them.”</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #343434;">Origen, writing around 246 AD, stated
            in his Commentary on Romans (Book V, 9) that “the Church received
            from the apostles the tradition of giving baptism even to infants.”<br>
          </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #343434;">Augustine argued that baptism was
            essential for salvation, contending that infant baptism demonstrated
            that even infants were affected by original sin and held accountable
            for it (On Marriage and Concupiscence 2.29.51, as cited in Pelikan,
            2009, p. 292). He also noted that the exorcisms performed during
            baptism indicated that children were vulnerable to demonic influence
            (On the Merits and Remission of Sins 1.23, 28, 39; 3.2.7; 3.3.6, as
            cited in Pelikan, 2009, p. 292; Ferguson, 2009, p. 162). This
            theological emphasis helped cement the practice of infant baptism in
            the broader church.</span><span style="color: #343434;"><br>
          </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">Infant baptism helped refine the
            doctrine of original sin, a connection first clearly articulated by
            Cyprian, who argued that invoking original sin validated a practice
            whose apostolic credentials were unquestioned (Pelikan, 2009, pp.
            165, 291, 292). Cyprian also reports that an African council ruled
            that newborns should not be barred from baptism, and by the fifth
            century, infant baptism was increasingly justified as a means of
            forgiving original sin, leading to its wider adoption (Lane, 2004,
            p. 117; Keeran, 2009, p. 12). </span></p>
