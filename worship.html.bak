      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>The first Christians gathered in homes, sharing meals and celebrating
          the Eucharist. Over time, these practices evolved into structured
          liturgies (The legalization of Christianity under Constantine in 313
          AD, and the establishment as the state religion of the Roman Empire in
          380 AD). </p>
        <p>Pre-Nicene Worship practices were rooted in the communal and
          liturgical traditions of the apostolic era, blending Jewish liturgical
          customs with distinct Christian theological emphases.</p>
        <p>The sources that attest to such a structure can be found in The New
          Testament (1st Century), The Didache (Late 1st–Early 2nd Century),
          Pliny the Younger (Early 2nd Century),&nbsp; Justin Martyr (Mid-2nd
          Century), The Epistle of Barnabas (Early 2nd Century),&nbsp; Ignatius
          of Antioch (Early 2nd Century),<span style="color: #2c3e50;"></span><span

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Baptized Christians, including men,
          women, and children, gathered on Sunday, called the "Lord’s Day," to
          celebrate Jesus’ resurrection. This practice is rooted in the <em>New
            Testament</em> (1st century), where believers met on the first day
          of the week to break bread, as recorded in Acts 20:7. Pliny the
          Younger, in his <em>Epistles</em> (10.96), describes Christians
          meeting before dawn on a fixed day, singing hymns to Christ, and
          binding themselves to ethical commitments, such as avoiding fraud,
          theft, adultery, and breaking promises. After these activities, they
          shared a communal meal, which was likely the Eucharist.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The <em>Epistle of Barnabas</em> (15:9)
          emphasizes the significance of Sunday, calling it the "eighth day" and
          a day of joy, marking Jesus’ resurrection. Justin Martyr, in his <em>First
            Apology</em> (67), explains that these gatherings took place in
          private homes or informal spaces, as there were no dedicated church
          buildings at the time. The primary purpose of these meetings was to
          commemorate Jesus’ resurrection and to strengthen the unity of the
          Christian community.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ignatius of Antioch, in his letters
          (early 2nd century), underscores the centrality of the Eucharist in
          these gatherings, emphasizing that it was a key act of worship.
          Tertullian, in his <em>Apology</em> (16), notes that Christians
          prayed facing east, symbolizing their expectation of Christ’s return.
          Hippolytus of Rome, in his <em>Apostolic Tradition</em> (early 3rd
          century), provides further details about how newly baptized members
          were integrated into the Sunday Eucharist. This weekly assembly was a
          central practice, uniting believers in faith and fellowship, and
          celebrating Christ’s victory over death.</p>

        <h1 id="worship-practices">Scripture Readings</h1>
        <p>Readings included the "memoirs of the apostles" (likely the Gospels)
          and the writings of the prophets. Justin Martyr writes:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are
            read, as long as time permits."</p>
          <p>- Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A reader proclaimed the texts aloud, a practice inherited from Jewish
          synagogue worship. These readings formed the foundation for teaching
          and reflection.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h1 id="worship-practices">Sermon</h1>
        <p>The bishop or presbyter (president of the assembly) delivered a
          sermon. Justin Martyr states:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"When the reader has finished, the president verbally instructs and
            exhorts to the imitation of these good things."</p>
          <p>- Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The sermon served to instruct and encourage believers in their faith,
          applying the scripture readings to their lives.</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <h1 id="worship-practices">Communal Prayer</h1>
        <p>The congregation prayed together, often standing and facing east.
          Tertullian writes:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"We pray looking toward the east, where the heaven of heavens is
            located."</p>
          <p>- Tertullian, <em>Apology</em> 16</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Prayers included intercessions for the church, the world, and those
          in need. Justin Martyr notes that these prayers were offered "with one
          heart and one voice" [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67].</p>

          <p>Baptized Christians, including men, women, and children, gathered
            together to worship and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. They
            assembled on Sunday, referred to as the "Lord’s Day," often early in
            the morning [Pliny the Younger, <em>Epistles</em> 10.96; <em>Epistle
              of Barnabas</em> 15:9]. Meetings took place in private homes or
            other informal gathering spaces, since dedicated church buildings
            did not yet exist [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 67]. The
            purpose of these gatherings was to commemorate Jesus’ resurrection
            and to strengthen the bonds of the Christian community.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"They met on a fixed day before dawn and sang responsively a hymn
              to Christ as to a god, bound themselves with an oath—not to some
              crime—but not to commit fraud, theft, or adultery, not to break a
              promise, and not to deny a deposit when called upon. After this,
              it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of
              food—ordinary and innocent food."</p>
            <p>- Pliny the Younger, <em>Epistles</em> 10.96</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"We keep the eighth day [Sunday] with joy, the day on which Jesus
              also rose from the dead."</p>
            <p>- <em>Epistle of Barnabas</em> 15:9</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>This weekly assembly was a central practice, uniting believers in
            faith and fellowship. The assembly was a joyful celebration of
            Christ’s victory over death, as reflected in the early Christian
            writings [Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 65–67].</p>

          <h1 id="worship-practices">Eucharist</h1>
          <p>The central act of worship was the Eucharist. Justin Martyr
            describes the process:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Bread and wine and water are brought, and the president offers
              prayers and thanksgivings according to his ability. There is a
              distribution to each, and a participation of that over which
              thanks have been given."</p>
            <p>- Justin Martyr, <em>First Apology</em> 65–67</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The <em>Didache</em> provides a Eucharistic prayer:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"We thank You, our Father, for the holy vine of David Your
              servant, which You made known to us through Jesus Your servant."</p>
            <p>- <em>Didache</em> 9:2</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Eucharist was understood as the body and blood of Christ.
            Ignatius of Antioch writes:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Let that be considered a valid Eucharist which is celebrated by
              the bishop or by one whom he appoints."</p>
            <p>- Ignatius of Antioch, <em>Epistle to the Smyrnaeans</em> 8</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Only those who were baptized and living in accordance with

        <p>Worship typically began with scripture readings from the "memoirs of
          the apostles" (likely the Gospels) and the prophets, a practice
          inherited from Jewish synagogue worship. These readings formed the
          foundation for teaching and reflection. A sermon followed, delivered
          by a bishop or presbyter, expounding on the texts and applying them to
          the lives of the congregation. This emphasized the didactic purpose of
          worship, instructing believers in the faith. The congregation then
          offered communal prayers, standing and facing east to symbolize the
          expectation of Christ’s return. These prayers, offered "with one heart
          and one voice," included intercessions for the church, the world, and
          those in need. The central act of worship was the Eucharist, where
          bread and wine were consecrated by the bishop through prayers of
          thanksgiving and shared among the baptized. Justin specifies that only
          those living in accordance with Christian teachings could partake, as
          the elements were understood as the body and blood of Christ.</p>

        <p>Early Christian worship was simple and communal. Services began with
          scripture readings and sermons, followed by prayers and the Eucharist.
          Justin Martyr, in the mid-2nd century, described this structure:
          readings from the apostles' memoirs and prophets, a sermon, communal
          prayers, and the sharing of bread and wine.</p>
        <p>Baptism was a key initiation rite. Candidates renounced Satan,
          professed faith, and were baptized naked in water. After baptism, they
          were clothed in white robes, anointed with oil, and participated in
          the Eucharist. This symbolized their new life in Christ.</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>Early Christians met in private homes, where they sang hymns, read
          scriptures, and commemorated the Last Supper. These gatherings were
          informal, often with animals present. The first churches were simple,
          built of heavy stones with few windows, and sometimes included
          defensive towers due to persecution.</p>
        <p>The earliest known church, built in the late 3rd century in Aila
          (modern-day Aqaba, Jordan), featured a central nave, side aisles, and
          an altar. The Dura-Europos church in Syria, dating to the mid-3rd
          century, is one of the earliest identified Christian house churches.</p>

      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>The Eucharist was central to early Christian liturgy. Justin Martyr
          described it as a thank offering, with the president offering prayers
          and thanksgivings, and the congregation responding with "Amen." The
          bread and wine were distributed to all, and deacons carried the
          consecrated elements to those unable to attend.</p>
        <p>Fasting was also important, especially before Easter. Initially, the
          fast lasted one day but was later extended to 40 hours, symbolizing
          Jesus' 40 days in the wilderness. Sunday, the "little Easter," was a
          day of joy, often preceded by fasting on Wednesday and Friday.</p>

      <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
      <div class="ds-markdown ds-markdown--block" style="--ds-md-zoom: 1.143;">
        <p>Early Christian worship was deeply communal, centered on the
          Eucharist, and marked by simplicity. Over time, as Christianity
          spread, worship practices became more structured, laying the
          foundation for the liturgy that would shape Christian worship for
          centuries.</p>
