    <h1>Is Veiling Only Cultural? A Theological Inquiry</h1>
    <p>This questionnaire evaluates whether the belief that veiling is merely
      cultural aligns with scriptural, historical, and theological evidence.
      Select "True" or "False" for each question to see the reasoning behind the
      answer.</p>
    <div id="question1" class="question">
      <h2>1. Paul connects veiling to creation. (e.g., angels, creation order,
        nature)</h2>
      <div class="answer-options"> <button onclick="showResponse('question1', 'true')">True</button>
        <button onclick="showResponse('question1', 'false')">False</button> </div>
      <div id="question1-true" class="response">
        <p><strong>Correct.</strong> Paul grounds veiling in the order of
          creation, making it a theological principle that transcends cultural
          boundaries. (Source: Antiveil Evidence 13)</p>
      </div>
      <div id="question1-false" class="response">
        <p><strong>Reconsider.</strong> Paul’s reference to creation (1
          Corinthians 11:7-9) indicates a universal theological principle, not a
          cultural one. (Source: Antiveil Evidence 13)</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="question2" class="question">
      <h2>2. Paul addresses only Corinth and not all churches.</h2>
      <div class="answer-options"> <button onclick="showResponse('question2', 'true')">True</button>
        <button onclick="showResponse('question2', 'false')">False</button> </div>
      <div id="question2-true" class="response">
        <p><strong>Reconsider.</strong> Paul addresses the wider Christian Body
          at the start of his letter. (See 1 Cor 1:2) "To the Assembly of God
          that is in Corinth, [and] to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called
          holy one") Paul asks Christians to distrubte his letters to all.
          (Colossians 4:16) "And when the letter may be read with you, cause that it may also be read in the assembly of the Laodiceans, and the one from Laodicea that you also read." </p>

      <div id="question2-false" class="response">
        <p><strong>The answer is False.</strong> Paul addresses the wider Christian Body
          at the start of his letter. (See 1 Cor 1:2) "To the Assembly of God

      <div id="question3-true" class="response">
        <p><strong>Reconsider.</strong> The long-standing tradition of veiling
          in Christian history contradicts the claim that it was merely a
          temporary cultural practice. (Source: Scholarrebuke Evidence 16)</p>
      </div>
      <div id="question3-false" class="response">
        <p><strong>Correct.</strong> Historical evidence shows veiling was a
          consistent Christian practice across centuries, not limited to Corinth
          or the 1st century. (Source: Scholarrebuke Evidence 16)</p>

        <button onclick="showResponse('question4', 'false')">False</button> </div>
      <div id="question4-true" class="response">
        <p><strong>Reconsider.</strong> Romans 12:2 (NIV) affirms Paul’s stance:

          the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve
          what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will." Paul
          prioritized theological principles over cultural conformity.</p>
